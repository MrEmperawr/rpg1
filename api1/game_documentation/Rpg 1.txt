Design philosophy
Rolls
For any situation, other than structured time such as combat, rolls should be one and done. Drawn out rolls rarely add anything to a game. As much as possible should be resolved by one roll per participating party.


Attributes
The basic idea is to have few attributes with equal numbers in each category Physical, Mental and Social. Following the fact that there are few attributes they should all be useful for a character. They don't have to be equally useful but there should be no “dump stat” that won't come back to haunt a player ever so often. No Attribute should feel useless and every attribute should contribute to something that benefits a character.


Skills
It is hard to balance skills. There should be neither too few or too many. Every skill should have a role to play and yet I wish to have the same number of skills in each category.
Magic
I wish to give rise to many sorts of spellcasters, magic is the realm of clerics, druids, scholarly wizards and demon-summoning warlocks. And they are not as locked in as a class-system like DnD. You want a druid who becomes a bear and spits lightning? That should be doable. but not without downsides.
Tolerance
I wish to have a system that keeps PCs from being so full of cyberware that they are effectively a robot or being a walking spell repository and to keep mages from simply augmenting themselves to godhood. I have yet to evaluate Tolerance properly. It is an early draft idea. I like the idea of tolerance being temporary, so the downsides can be overcome by tearing out cyber or stop sustaining spells.
Combat
This is very difficult. As all developers know you cannot have it all. I want combat that flows faster than shadowrun, rarely messes with action economy, and can feel both epic and deadly.
PC death should not be an overly common experience as this often slows down story progression. But at the same time, the insane Hobo with a shotgun should feel like he could be a real risk unless your character is a cybered troll in combat armor. At the same time if your trained fighting character cannot take down a hobo in a heartbeat you’ll feel weak.


Additionally you want to give tactical options to PCs without overwhelming the table with situational bonuses and penalties. This is likely one of the largest flaws of this combat system, yet I do not like the advantage/disadvantage rules of DnD. 


Combat is meant to be risky and potentially deadly for most characters. Inspired by the sort of ruthless danger seen in the likes of “The Witcher”, “The Last of Us”, and other action dramas.


























Rules
1. Have fun. Don’t take the rules too seriously if they make it less fun.
2. GM may overrule any rule when they feel it does not make sense at the moment.
3. If rules contradict each other, specific rules trump general rules, an action or spell that seems to break a general rule set takes precedence.
4. It is better to ignore a rule if it slows down the game too much. GM fiat.
5. Optional rules are optional. Consult your GM.


How to play
The game is played using six sided dice (D6)
You make a pool of dice, normally made up of ratings of attribute + skill (or attribute + attribute) +/- other factors such as situational modifiers or equipment.


5s and 6s constitute successes. If the roll of your dice pool has as many successes as the difficulty threshold you succeed. 
Critical successes: If you have half again as many successes as required (rounded up) that is an impressive success, if you have twice as many as required then that is an exceptional success.


1s on the dice do NOT remove successes however, too many 1s indicate a complication.


If you have at least as many 1s as you have successes, then you suffer a minor complication. 
These typically give you a small penalty to a future roll, or force you to take a simple action. Such as getting unbalanced, your gun jamming or someone you’re following feels like something is wrong without spotting you.


If half your dice pool or more come up 1s (rounded up) you suffer a major complication. 
These typically result in significant one time penalties, future consequences or damage.
Such as falling prone in combat, dropping your gun, someone you’re following going to the wrong location or hurting yourself.


If you suffer a major complication and you rolled no successes, that is a dramatic failure.
These typically result in devastating penalties, long term consequences or egregious bodily harm.
Such as your gun exploding, the person you followed leads you into an ambush, you become persona non-grata for a social group or long term injury.


Examples.
Orcus the orc is trying to smash down a door. He is rolling his brawn (9) + unarmed (2) + equipment, steel boots (1) for a total of 12 dice. The door is not very sturdy so Orcus needs 3 successes.


Success: orcus rolls 3 successes, the door is broken down.


Impressive success: Orcus rolls 5 successes, the door is broken down and the noise isn’t loud enough to reach anyone outside this floor.


Exceptional success: Orcus rolls 6 successes, he smashes through the door and hits the person inside the room for full damage as if there was never any door.


Minor complication: orcus rolls 3 successes, the door is broken down. but he also rolls 3 1s, his leg is bruised from kicking, he takes one bashing damage. Alternatively the GM may declare that his action was extra noisy and will likely draw someone to investigate.


Major Complication: orcus rolls 3 successes, the door is broken down. But he also rolls 6 1s, half his pool. Orcus slams through the door straight onto the occupants' waiting blade. Alternatively the occupant already had time to flee out the window.


Dramatic Failure: Orcus rolls no successes and 6 1s Half his dice pool. He slams against the door and fails to do any damage. Additionally he trips and falls backwards, just as guards come to investigate the noise…
Base thresholds:
1: Routine, don't bother rolling unless character is heavily penalized. Example: academics or science, basic addition.


2: Easy, most people will rarely fail. Example: craft, whittle a sharpened stake.


3: Average, a professional will rarely fail. Example: athletics, throwing a grenade to land inside a 1m by 1m area.


4: Tricky, a professional will fail ever so often. Example: Survival: hunting deer.


5-6. Difficult, a professional will fail often. Example: Performance, perform an unpracticed monologue from a play.


7-8. Very difficult, a professional will fail more than succeed. Example: ranged weapons, split an arrow with yours.


9-10. Insane, a professional will maybe manage this once or a few times in their career but few would risk it. Example: Pilot: Landing an aircraft on another aircraft in flight.


One and done
Dice Rolls outside structured time should resolve a task. Repeating dice rolls willy-nilly make rolls feel unimportant or lacking in finality. Therefore tasks cannot be retried outside using the retry action or significantly changing dice pools. If you fail to repair the car you need either assistance, better tools, return when you have greater skill, or to have someone else do it.


Terms and definitions
All action/wound penalty: All action penalties can come from a variety of sources. Most commonly from wounds or magic. All action penalties remove dice from all things you roll, excepting resistance checks and healing rolls.[d] On initiative they act as a flat penalty instead of removing dice.


Area: Things that affect an area such as spells and effects affect everything within a certain range from the point of origin, (such as the position of the grenade or target of the spell) most area effects affect things within the distance, engaged; meaning right next to the point of origin, or close; meaning roughly within the same room. Keep in mind that they can also affect the thrower/caster if they are too close.


Augmented Maximum: Nothing can make a stat exceed its natural value +5 or more than twice its natural value, whichever is lower. A character's skills or attributes cannot be increased by more than +5 or twice its natural value using drugs, magic, or cyber enhancements. So someone boosting their natural Brawn of 7, can at most end up with 11 (+4).
This also applies to skills, armor and any other statistic. Similarly an item's damage or armor value also cannot be augmented past this limit meaning that a greatsword can receive a greater bonus than a dagger.
There may be exceptions to this rule when specified on the specific spell or effect.


Chance Die: If your character tries a roll where their Dice Pool is zero or negative, they are permitted to roll a chance die. A chance die is a single D6 that is only a Success on a 6.
Rolling a 1 on this die of course means a Dramatic Failure.


Exploding 6s work as normal on chance dice but the rerolls are also only successes on a 6.




Complications: A negative situational effect that does not change your success or failure.
(Minor): Rolled 1s equal to or in greater numbers than successes. Something went awry, your roll may still succeed but something went wrong as well. 
(Major) Rolled 1s equal to half your dice pool or more. Something went really awry, your roll may still succeed but something is going to really complicate the situation further.
(Dramatic Failure) Rolled 1s equal to half your dice pool or more and rolled no success. Everything goes horribly wrong and your character loses something important, gets hurt or suffers a great setback.


Condition: Something is affecting the character. They can be major or minor, positive or negative, physical, mental or social.


Defense: there are multiple ways to defend. This can be either the character’s Dodge (Athletics + Wits), Parry (Melee + Wits) or Magical shield (Magical Skill + Wits). 


Difficulty Threshold (DT): this is the number of successes your character needs to accumulate on their roll to succeed.


Game Master (GM): The GM runs the game, describing the environments, arbitrating rules and playing NPCs.


Modified armor value: effective armor value of all armor layers -Armor piercing value.


Natural value: Value of a skill or attribute without modification from magic, technology, Qualities, situational bonuses or equipment.


Net Successes: The amount of successes rolled above the threshold or opposing successes.


Non Player Character (NPC): NPCs is any character not played by a Player. It is normally portrayed by the GM.


Opposed rolls: Sometimes you are not rolling against a threshold but rather another character. Example: arm wrestling, may be brawn + Cool vs. the other characters brawn + Cool. You count the successes of the opposing roll as the threshold, but a tie means that neither character entirely succeeds. In arm wrestling the competition likely goes on in other cases the situation may resolve with neither side gaining all they want.


Optional rule: If your group wishes to decrease dice rolling you may substitute the following:
NPCs don’t roll. Instead of rolling the dice for NPCs they set the threshold for the roll equal to ⅓ of their dice pool rounded up.


Critical Success: A roll has more successes than it needed and bestows an extra positive outcome.
(Impressive success): Rolled half again as many successes as needed (i.e. 6 successes on a difficulty 4 check). The roll , must be a minimum of 3 successes total (if opposing roll is 0 for example). You not only succeed but do it in such a way that the situation becomes slightly easier.[e] Alternative rule: 3 net successes.
(Exceptional success) Rolled twice as many successes as needed (i.e. 8 successes on a difficulty 4 check.) The roll , must be a minimum of 4 successes total (if opposing roll is 0 for example).[f] You succeed with gusto and do it in such a way that the situation is much improved for you. Alternative rule: 5 net successes.
        
Suggested outcomes: Some actions have suggestions for Critical successes, stated as “Exceptional success can be used to…” These are merely suggestions and NOT the only possible use for Critical successes.


Reaction: Indicates that an action can be performed outside your turn as long as you are not surprised and have an appropriate action to spend.


Reach: Indicates how much a character with a weapon can keep attackers at bay or reach inside someone's guard.
Reach is (weapon size + species modifier) Some weapons have a reach bonus,


Rounding: When a fractional value is used (such as brawn/2) You always round up unless the particular example specifies otherwise.[g]


Soak: (Brawn/2 rounded up + armor value  - armor piercing). Soak is the amount your character ignores from a source of damage


Size: a generalized term for an object or person's length, weight and general encumbrance. It is far from perfect but should give a general idea how hard something is to wield, carry or hit.


Teamwork: When assisting each other; the players choose one Character to perform the “main” roll (the one that counts for the final result). Other characters, (assuming they can all fit to perform the action) can roll as well. But their successes count as extra dice to the main roll. The main roll can only receive as many dice as the Character has ranks in the used skill (minimum 2).




Character Creation
Character creation options:
Types of character creation
You should agree as a group on what your Character creation option should be. In the end the GM has final say on what kind of game they wish to run.
For new groups it is recommended to start with number 1.


1. Get points that can be spent freely among attributes and points that can be spent freely among skills. Up to limits.
2. Spend points freely without limits
3. Get experience, free spending but with limits.
4. Get experience to spend completely freely without limits.


Starting points
You should agree as a group on what your starting point should be. In the end the GM has final say on what kind of game they wish to run.
For new groups it is recommended to start at “Something Special”.
Setting limits at character creation will make the PCs feel like they can grow and make progress with the downside that they feel less heroic, special or even capable. So where to set limits is a choice that sets the starting tone for your game. None of these force the players to specialize but should come with the level of difficulty you are setting.


Attribute limits make use of the species starting value as listed in the species table. Humans starting value is 3 + the added points from their versatile nature (so they will have starting value 4 in 4 different attributes.)


1. Underdog. Your character is in the early stages of their career. They may still be attending school or learning the ropes. Anyone with experience is likely either better or equal to your character. Example: School kid, apprentice, trainee, urchin
   1. Attribute limit Species starting value +2 (one at +3)
   2. Skill limit: 4 (one at 5)
Points
* 8 Attribute points                 (exp: 80)
* 16 Skill points                         (exp: 64)
* 1 Specialties                         (exp: 3)
* 4 Quality points                 (exp: 8)


        Experience (instead of points)
* 155






2. Nothing special: Your character knows what they are doing. They equal other typical professionals and may even shine where they have specialties. Example: City guard/police officer, hedge wizard, smith
   1. Attribute limit: Species starting value +3 (One at +4)
   2. Skill limit: 5 (one at 6)
Points
* 12 Attribute points                (exp: 120)
* 24 Skill points                        (exp: 96)
* 2 Specialties                         (exp: 6)
* 6 Quality Points                 (exp: 12)


        Experience (instead of points)
* 234






3. Something special: Your character is a capable professional or natural talent. They are good at what they do and really shine where they have specialties. Example: Knight, swat, court wizard, expert craftsman
   1. Attribute limit: Species starting value +4, choose 1 attribute with no limit (other than species maximum).
   2. Skill limit: 6 (two at 7)
Points
* 18 attribute points                 (exp: 180)
* 36 skill points                         (exp: 144)
* 3 Specialties                         (exp: 9)
* 8 Quality points                 (exp: 16)


        Experience (instead of points)
* 349






4. Heroic: No limits, go nuts. depending on how specialized your character is there may be little improvement to make in the best skills but rather learning a broader approach. Example: Action hero, archmage, Genius inventor.
Points
* 24 Attribute points                 (exp: 240)
* 48 Skill points                         (exp: 192)
* 4 Specialties                        (exp: 12)
* 10 Quality points                (exp: 20)


Experience (instead of points)
* 464




Character creation Steps:


For character creation follow the following steps
1. Character concept
2. Virtue and Vice
3. Choose Species
4. Spend Attribute points
5. Spend Skill Points
6. Assign Skill Specialties
7. Spend Quality points
8. Choose negative qualities
9. Spend experience from negative qualities
10. Purchase Gear
11. Calculate Derived Stats
12. Name Character


If using free XP spending then replace step 4-7 with “Spend XP”.
1. Character concept
The first step in creating a character is to determine what that character should be. Inspiration for a character can be taken from popular media, pictures or one's own fantasy.


Using this inspiration create a short descriptive phrase, such as: Disillusioned ex-military orc, or Proud Knight Errant, Greedy Halfling Thug or Kind-Hearted Troll Druid.


You can of course change this phrase, it is only meant to be a guide for how to build and play your character.


2. Virtue and Vice
Fulfilling Virtues and Vices are completely optional. Keep in mind to not follow them in ways that ruin other peoples fun.
Virtue
Characters can be driven by all sorts of personal convictions or experiences. But most people have one particularly strong conviction, something that makes them feel morally superior or at least makes them feel like a good person. This is a character’s Virtue.


A virtue can be any positive character conviction. Examples include: Charitable, kind, generous, Helpful, Loyal, Faithful, Protective, etc.


When a character makes a sacrifice for their Virtue they regain a willpower. (Example: a protective character stays by their friend even when threatened)


When they make a major sacrifice or put themselves in mortal danger for their Virtue then they regain all willpower. (Example: A protective character throws themselves in front of an attack meant for their friend.)
Vice
Characters can enjoy all sorts of Vices and fall victim to a myriad of temptations. However most have some vice that is particularly hard to resist. Something that they take exceptional pleasure in indulging in to the point that they get themselves or others in trouble. This is a character’s Vice.


A vice can be any negative indulgence. Examples include: Wrathful, Gluttonous, Deceptive, Greedy, Selfish, etc.


When a character gets someone in trouble, or fails to fulfill an obligation in order to fulfill their Vice they regain a Willpower. (Example: a selfish character leaves their friend in trouble to save their own skin.)


When their indulgence causes potentially lethal harm or difficulty they regain all spent Willpower. (Example: a selfish character may throw a grenade into a room in which their friends are fighting in order to not risk being hurt themselves.)
3. Species


Species Attributes: The left number (before the slash) is the Species Starting Value for a particular attribute. Any points spent add to this number. The right number (after the slash) is the maximum unaugmented value in the attribute for the species.


Example: a dwarf character starts at 5 brawn, they cannot have less than 5 starting brawn without a negative quality lowering this number. They have a maximum of 12 Brawn. They can’t spend experience to go higher than this number unless they have a quality that specifically permits it.

Species Special: Every species has something in addition to their attributes that make them special. Some of these should be self explanatory but the others are listed here.


Nightvision: Dwarves have Night Vision which halves all penalties for darkness except for complete darkness or blindness. This does not stack with other sources of night vision and replacing the eyes removes natural night vision.


Keen Senses: Elves have very keen ears and eyes. They get Exploding 6s on perception checks for sights and sounds. If elves replace their eyes or ears they lose this bonus.


Lucky: Halflings always seem to be lucky when it matters. When spending a Willpower point to increase a dice pool they receive Exploding 6s on the affected roll. This does not apply when spending Willpower to activate a special ability or retry.


Versatile: Humans have no distinct racial strength or weakness, instead they as a species can be capable in just about any field. Humans get +1 rating to 4 separate attributes. This bonus is not affected by character creation limits. It cannot however, be used to bypass the racial maximum (10).


Fearsome: Orcs have a way about them that makes them particularly intimidating. They get Exploding 6s on intimidation checks performed in person. This bonus does not apply to threatening letters or other situations when the Orcs voice AND appearance are hidden.
Pain tolerance: Orcs have a culture of toughness and have learned to not let minor pain affect them. They do not suffer a wound penalty for their first 3 wounds instead suffer -1 when they reach 6 wounds. This can be combined with the pain tolerance Quality and other sources of pain tolerance, such as drugs.


Thick skinned: Trolls have rough and craggy skin that is particularly resistant to wounds. They receive 1 natural armor. This follows the normal rules of natural armor when layered. If the Troll replaces their skin with skin augmentations they lose this bonus, the same is true for the armor on any cyberlimb. It does however stack with other armor augmentations such as bone lacing.
Fast healer: Trolls have remarkable rates of recovery. They half wound recovery times. This does stack with the “Fast Healer” Quality and other things that impact recovery rates unless they specify otherwise.




4. Attributes
Attributes measure your character's natural abilities, gained through genetics or hard work.
For details on the individual attributes see the Attributes chapter.


At character creation your Attributes start at the value indicated by your chosen species.
After that you can spend the Attribute points as indicated in your starting point. If you are playing with limits then they limit how high your final attribute can be. Otherwise you are limited only by the species maximum.


Example: if you have chosen to play an orc then your attributes start at 5. 3. 3. 3. 5. 2.
Starting at “Something Special” you would have 18 Attribute points to spend and only one Attribute may be set at maximum Species Limit. The rest can be set at starting value +4.


So the orc in the example above may spend the 18 points to get Brawn: 9 (4 points) Agility: 6 (3 points) Logic: 5 (2 point) Wits: 5 (2 points) Power: 9 (4 points)  Cool: 5 (3 points)

5. Skills
Skills measure your character’s training in various areas. Such as professional training, exercise or experience in a field.


At character creation your skills, unlike your Attributes, start at 0. You can then spend the Skill points from your starting points. If you are playing with limits then they limit the maximum ranks you can have at character creation. Otherwise no skill can go above rating 10.


Example: if you start at “Something Special” then you would have 36 points to spend among the skills with maximum 7 in two Skills and 6 [h]in the rest. Of course, you are not required to max out any skills.


In order to put points in magical skills you will need to purchase “The Gift” or “Incomplete Gift” Quality in the Qualities portion.


Example: The orc in the example is going to be a fighter. So he gets Athletics: 6, Melee: 7, Pilot: 2, Ranged: 4, Unarmed: 4, Crafts: 4, Nature Lore: 4, Intimidation: 5
6. Skill Specialties
Skill specialties represent a narrow field of study for your character. Each specialty is tied to a particular skill. There are two kinds of specialties: A typical Specialty grants the character +2 when using a skill in the specified way. An Exotic Specialty grants the character the ability to use their Skill rating for a field the skill does not otherwise allow, such as Computer Hacking with the Science skill.


At character creation you get a number of specialties tied to starting points. Starting at “Something Special” you would have 3 Specialties.


For more information on skill specialties see the Skills Chapter.


Example: The orc in the examples above wishes to be a more capable combatant and so puts a Specialty for “Axes” in the Melee skill for +2 with axes and 2 Specialties in Athletics for Dodge and Throwing.


7. Positive Qualities
Qualities represent something more unique to your character than Attributes, Skills and Specialties. They can represent things your character was born with, picked up through life or something they have accomplished.


Qualities all have a numerical value. This represents the number of Quality Points it costs to acquire the particular Positive Quality. Some Qualities have a range of numbers, this means that you can acquire multiple ratings of the Quality for different bonuses. Such as fighting styles that range from 1-5. To purchase rating 2, you first have to purchase rating 1. But each rating still only costs 1 point.


Be well aware of the “Wealthy” quality as it increases the amount of money you can start with at character creation. Furthermore, note that to get a magical skill you need to purchase “The Gift” or “Incomplete Gift” qualities.


For a list of Qualities, see the Qualities Chapter.


Example: Starting at “Something Special” the Orc in the examples above would have 8 Quality Points to spend. The orc is still set on being a warrior and so gets the “Size queen” two-handed weapon Fighting style to rating 4 (4 points). He also wishes to be a good tracker so he gets the “Bloodhound” quality (2 points), wanting to be able to take a beating he also gets the Pain tolerance at rating 2 (2 points) (getting the next level (4) would cost another 2 points.)
8. Negative Qualities
Negative Qualities represent special flaws in your character. Negative Qualities are entirely optional, but often your character's flaws can be the most interesting part of your character. Additionally Negative qualities give you extra experience to spend. This experience does not count against your total received XP for purposes of calculation. If you spend the experience during character creation then they are still subject to any applicable Attribute and Skill limits. Any unspent experience after game start will be subject to training time in order to spend just like any experience earned after game start.
A character can pick any number of Negative Qualities but can only receive a maximum of 15 Experience Points from it.


Example: The Orc in the previous examples get the negative qualities: Uneducated (6 XP) and Heavy (4 XP) For a total of 10 XP received.
9. Spend Experience
If you have picked any Negative Qualities then you have received some Experience Points that you can spend experience points to increase Attributes, Skills, acquire Skill Specialties or Quality points. If you spend the experience during character creation then they are still subject to any applicable Attribute and Skill limits. Any unspent experience after game start will be subject to training time in order to spend just like any experience earned after game start.
Different stats have different Experience Point costs. They are as follows:




Attribute point: 10 XP
Skill point: 4 XP
Specialty: 3 XP
Quality Point: 2 XP




Example: The orc in the examples above has 10 XP to spend. He increases his Pilot Skill from 2 to 4 for 8XP and saves the remaining 2 XP.




10. Starting Equipment
Characters start with 6000c worth of Equipment. Any Money not spent on equipment will be kept as money when the game starts.


Each starting point has a maximum Rarity for each piece of starting equipment.


Underdog:  Max Rarity 2
Nothing Special: Max Rarity 3
Something Special: Max Rarity 5
Heroic:  Max Rarity 10




For those who wish to start with more money can buy the “Wealthy” positive quality.


Those who wish for less gear can get the “Poor” negative quality.


At character creation everyone starts with 1 month of Poor lifestyle. The Poor Negative quality at two ranks lowers starting lifestyle to Destitute. To start with a higher lifestyle you need to pay the difference. 




See the Equipment Chapter for more details.


Cyber Era
If you are playing in the cyber era it is strongly recommended to purchase a Comlink which functions similar to a modern smartphone. It is also recommended to purchase something like glasses with Augmented Reality (unless your character has cyber eyes) so that they can experience all the world has to offer.


Example


Example: The orc in the examples above buys a Greataxe (2000), A leather breastplate (800), A back quiver 200, with 20 standard arrows (100), an a longbow (800)


His clothes and food are included with starting lifestyle so he does not need to pay for them as of yet.


This leaves him with 2100c (6000-3900).
11. Derived Stats
Health = Size + Brawn
Carrying capacity = Size x2 + Brawn
Willpower Points = Cool
Willpower bonus = Logic/2 (round up)
Initiative bonus = Agility + Wits
Perception = Wits + Cool
Physical resistance = Brawn + Cool
Mental resistance = Logic + Cool
Dodge = Wits + Athletics
Lethal Threshold = Armor Rating x2


Example: The orc in the above examples would have:
Health: 14 (Size 5 + Brawn 9)
Carrying Capacity: 19 (Size 5 x2 + Brawn 9)
Willpower Points: 5 (Cool 5)
Willpower Bonus: 3 (Logic 5 /2)
Initiative Bonus: 11 (Agility 6 + Wits 5)
Perception: 10 (Wits 5 + Cool 5)
Physical Resistance: 14 (Brawn 9 + Cool 5)
Mental Resistance: 10 (Logic 5 + Cool 5)
Dodge: 13 (Wits 5 + Athletics 6 + Specialty Dodge +2)


12. Character Name
Decide your character name. Names may vary a great deal based on Era and Culture.


Example: The orc in the examples above chooses “Orcus” his people do not use last names, he hopes to earn a better moniker one day than “Orcus the Orc”.


Character advancement
Earning experience
Automatic: 1
Progression: 0-2
Role Playing: 0-2
(Average per session should be 2-4


Training time
(Stand-in Rule: To train anything you have to spend 2 days training per experience point spent, 12 hours spent per day, it can be split over longer time.)


Tutors: By hiring a tutor who gives you individual training you can shorten your training time to 1 day per experience point spent at the cost of 500c per day. It is very expensive as you are asking someone to dedicate all their time to your improvement and they must be very capable in their field. You must use a tutor for the entire duration of your training in order to receive the benefit, stopping in the middle will do more harm than good.


Learning materials: Instead of proper direction by a tutor your character can try to use existing materials; classes, books, videos etc. Using these materials lowers the total training time for a particular increase by 2 days, at the total cost of 400c. This cannot be combined with a tutor as it is assumed that the tutor already makes use of such materials.


In the end it is up to the GM to determine if there are accessible tutors or materials for your character's particular training.


You can only increase each individual stat by 1 point per training period. (Qualities that require more ranks to have any effect can be trained up to one effective increase.)


Ex. Training an attribute will take 20 days without assistance.
Ex. Training an attribute will take 10 days and cost 5000c with a tutor.
Ex. Training an attribute will take 18 days and cost 400c with Learning Materials.




(Alternative Rule: To train a skill you have to use it in game a number of times equal to the new rank, An attribute 3x new rank (I like the flavor of this but expect it to be too much bookkeeping)


Species
Dwarves
Stats: 
Attributes: +2 Brawn, +2 Logic, -1 Agility
Species trait: Darkvision, Sturdy: +2 Health
Size: 4


Description: Dwarves are short, few measure above 120 cm. However, dwarves are exceptionally durable and stocky. It is not uncommon for dwarves to weigh at least as much as a full grown human despite being much shorter.


Dwarves’ skin color is that of stone or earth. Anything from obsidian to white marble and anything in between. Many earthy colors can pass for similar human skins but colors such as the gray of granite stands out. Some dwarves even have birthmarks of golden, iron, or other ore.


Dwarves typically reach physical maturity at 20 years of age and can live to 160 -180, the oldest dwarves may even get past 200.


Magic: Dwarves unsurprisingly have a much higher prevalence of shapers, Earth mages, than other species. It is said that when they were first created they could all control the earth, but it is unclear if there is any truth to the legends. The smallest prevalence is Air magic.


Stereotypes: Dwarves are often thought of as: loyal, greedy and never letting things go.
These ideas all have roots in how dwarven civilization developed. 


Through most of dwarven history they have lived in tight knit family clans. In the underground settlements space was limited and each dwarf had to prove that they deserved a space in the clan and each clan had to prove that they deserved a space in the settlement. Thus a dwarfs loyalty and honor had to be unquestionable. This becomes less and less relevant as dwarves integrate with other civilizations but it is still an important part of culture, one that more devious dwarves are happy to exploit.


The infamous greed of dwarves stems from the fact that while minerals and metals are available underground, food is far more scarce. Dwarven settlements often had to trade for food and other surface wares. Meaning that a dwarven merchant who sold material or craftwork for a lower price could be causing starvation in their clan.


Dwarven memory is seemingly eternal. That is because the dwarves, for many centuries beyond the likes of humans, used stone as their primary writing material. If you make or break a promise to a dwarf, expect it to be written in stone.


Place in civilization: In the medieval era dwarves are still mostly concentrated in their mountainous and underground settlements. Their limited food and space makes them far less populous than humans and orcs. They are known for their masterful metal and stonework as well as their shapers. Crafting and shaping are so deeply ingrained in dwarven cultures and many clans carefully guard crafting techniques. 
Shaping and crafting are primarily the domain of dwarven women, following in the footsteps of the first shaper, the goddess Gaia, who is the rumored creator of the dwarven race.
That leaves dwarven men with more destructive work, such as warfare and mining.
Not to be forgotten are the dwarven merchants who ensure that the crafts and materials can be turned into food and other necessities that are lacking underground.
Following in the footsteps of Gaia is seen as the greatest honor in dwarven society and as only women can create new beings as Gaia did the traditional Dwarven societies are strictly matriarchal.


In later eras dwarves, like most others, become more part of the civilizations around them. There are of course those that follow the old ways but for example a male dwarf who wishes to be a smith will likely see far more success in the outside world where his work will not be judged based on his sex.
Many dwarves are also happy to get out of the stymied old traditions of the stone and take the chance to live lives and find professions that are not available in the old ways. Which in turn means that some dwarven children rebel by returning to their ancestral clans… 
Teenagers, am I right?


Origin: It is said that in the primeval times, the Earth Goddess Gaia dug herself into the very depths of the earth, in great sorrow for the many divine lives lost in a struggle she created the “little ones”, the Dwarves, from the petrified flesh of fallen gods. At first all dwarves could freely shape the earth and draw nutrients from the soil. But as they split up into groups and began digging in different directions they slowly became less and less connected to the Astral realm of Earth and became more flesh and bone. After countless millennia dwarves started reaching the surface world only to find it too big, open, and already inhabited by all sorts of beings. Thus dwarves claim to be the oldest race of this world but there is little evidence remaining of their origin.
Elves
Stats: 
Attributes: +2 Agility, +2 Cool, -1 Brawn
Species trait: Keen Senses
Size: 5




Description: Elves typically have the same ranges of height as humans do, males typically measure 160-185 cm and females 150-175. However this varies greatly based on region and generational prosperity.


Elves are typically less muscular than humans and have a much more slender appearance that is often considered beautiful. This also means that they typically weigh less than their shorter lived counterparts with men typically weighing 45-75 KG and women a wispy 40-65.


Elves are renowned for their longevity. Reaching adulthood at 22 they often live to around 300 but the oldest known elf is said to have been past 500 years old.


Magic: Elves have a high prevalence of individuals born with the gift of Nature or to a smaller extent Illusion magic. Most uncommon is summoning.


Stereotypes: Elves are often thought of as prideful and isolationist but with strong ties to nature.


Elven age and perceived beauty definitely adds to both the elven pride and isolationism. When other species interact with them they often lack much of the elves' life experience. “Come talk to me when you’re 100 years older" is not an uncommon sentiment. On top of that elves can only conceive once per year, which keeps their communities growing slowly by human standards.
Exasperation with elves is only enhanced by their looks. Many people from other species may try to court them to the point of exhaustion. How would you feel if you were constantly hounded by star struck people of less than half your age?


Elves are said to originally hail from the plane of faeries, a place of magic and lush nature. And they do have a strong connection to Nature magic. This means that they have often used this to their advantage to protect and feed themselves.


Place in civilization: Elven settlements are often nested in forests, jungles or other areas of bountiful nature and they seek to live as part of nature rather than carving it away. They tend to use nature and earth magic to make themselves living homes. But they are often forced to trade for metals and other things not commonly found among greenery. 
In the medieval era elven lack of heavy industry serves them well as long as they have magic to make up for their shortcomings. However, in the later eras elves quickly find themselves forced to adapt to the lifestyle of other humanoids or perish. Arrows and magically controlled birds are a poor defense against attack helicopters.


Some elven lands have adapted, but many elves have found themselves forced to integrate and accept the new world orders of industry and capitalism. Elves often make extremely long term plans for family, career and reaching life goals. But younger elves do not seldom reject this lifestyle and instead wish to live hard and fast like humans, orcs and halflings.


Origin: Elves supposedly hail from the astral realm of the Fey, why exactly they migrated to this realm en masse is unknown but oral histories tell of a great war or cataclysm. Elves often claim that they are descendants of civilizations lasting millions of years which enhances their racial pride.
While none of this is certain, it is true that there is next to no evidence of elves prior to the early bronze age. And many elven mages are desperate to make Astral journeys back into the realm to recover something of the past, these missions are highly dangerous and have yet to bring back anything conclusive about past elven societies.


Halflings
Stats: 
Attributes: +2 Agility +2 Wits -1 Brawn, +1 Initiative
Species trait: Lucky
Size: 4




Description: Halflings look very much like miniature humans. Some have a very youthful appearance making them seem like human children and some have more pointed ears, but these traits are not universal.
Halflings typically do not grow taller than 1m and rare is the halfling that exceeds 50Kg.
The little folk live short, fast lives. Reaching full maturity at age 10 and most won't live past 40.


Magic: Halflings have a slight excess in those born with Illusion and Air magic.


Stereotypes: Halflings are often thought of as uneducated, reckless and with a propensity for thievery.


The reason for Halflings being perceived as reckless and uneducated both stem from their short lifespans. While they mature faster than humans and as children learn slightly faster, few of them have any interest in spending half their lives in school, and it is often said that halflings will feel like time passes half as fast. Thus they easily get bored, and not many want to get a doctorate just to be at retirement age.


They also typically focus on the here and now. When life is fast there is little reason to look to the past or future, such ponderings are typically left to the elderly. Instead if something seems like a fun idea, Halflings are likely to jump on it with little regard for future consequences. Maybe there isn’t that much difference between a Halfling 15 year old and a human one, despite the difference in physical maturity.


Their reputation for being thieves and scoundrels is a mix of historical truth and stereotyping. When you don’t think of consequences it is easier to end up performing criminal acts, furthermore halflings have never quite fit well into other societies and so turn to thievery more often than those who fit in. Then it doesn’t help that they are quite well suited to be pickpockets and burglars.


Place in civilization: Halflings do have villages and nomadic homesteads of their own but typically join other societies because building takes a lot of time and planning, time that could be spent on more interesting things.


In the medieval and industrial era, halflings are often used as messengers, day laborers and other fast professions. Fear the halfling auctioneer.


In later eras they remain as the most common delivery drivers, they show great aptitude for piloting, driving and so are prized in those professions. The best race car drivers are typically halflings. They also do great as performers, bartenders and anything that requires reflexes or a quick hand. However, as many modern professions require more education that Halflings are likely to get and so they are still often shunted to society's periphery and forced into less savory work.


Origin: Most halflings have little interest in the origin of their species. The only ones who care are usually the elderly (by halfling standards) which means that there is little history, written or oral. What is known is that there is little evidence of halflings before the iron age but even then halflings rarely build large or long lasting structures which means that few archaeological remains can be found. It is possible that halflings are a biological offshoot of humans but it seems unlikely.
A favorite hypothesis, especially among halflings themselves, is that they were put on this world as a joke by the trickster god Dolus. Whether this was a joke on the world, the halflings, or both, is a hotly debated topic among older halflings particularly when drunk.
Humans
Stats: 
Attributes: +1 to Four separate Attributes, does not increase maximum rating.
Species trait: Special Interest
Size: 5




Description: Humans are a diverse race characterized by their wide range of physical attributes. On average, they stand between 152 to 183 centimeters tall, with skin tones varying from fair to dark. Their hair comes in a multitude of colors, including shades of black, brown, blonde, red, and even unconventional hues. The eyes of humans can mesmerize with colors such as brown, blue, green, hazel, and grey.


Humans have a bipedal structure with two arms and two legs, each ending in five digits. They exhibit diverse body shapes and sizes, spanning from slender and lithe to muscular and stocky builds. Their facial features are highly varied, encompassing differences in nose shapes, eye placements, and jawlines that make each human unique in appearance.


Humans reach adulthood at 18 years of age and are known to live for around 70 to 100 years, their lifespan influenced by factors including lifestyle, environment, and access to healthcare. Those with state of the art healthcare from magic or tech may well live to 150.
Renowned for their ingenuity, curiosity, and adaptability, humans have the resilience and resourcefulness to excel in a vast array of environments and challenges.


Magic: Humans do not have a higher rate of individuals gifted with any one sort of magic. However they do have a slightly higher rate of people born with the complete gift instead of any one partial Gift.


Stereotypes: Humans don’t share much in the way of character traits, but other species often find them destructive, intrusive and domineering. The way they have spread across the world with little regard for other species, environment or even other humans, makes them a common object of hate.


They are also often thought of as staunch individualists, while many families and societies value community over the individual it is rarely to the level of the smaller dwarven and elven realms.


Place in civilization: There is no one job or position that fits humans specifically and there are few that cannot be done by the right human. Humans are so diverse that they can do well in just about any area, however the greatest in a particular field is rarely a human.


Origin: Humans are believed to have evolved from apes. Whether this is due to influence of the gods or simply a part of the nature Silvanus created is frequently debated. 
Orcs
Stats: 
Attributes: +2 Brawn +2 Power -1 Cool
Species trait: Fearsome, Pain resistance
Size: 5




Description: Orc physiology is very much like a human on steroids. Stronger, taller and heavier than humans they usually stand between 175-210 cm tall, and weighing 70-140 Kg.
Most orcs have protruding tusks in their mouth and slightly pointed ears. Their skin varies greatly from dark to grey or even green or red. Some orcs have small horns on their forehead.
Orcs on average live slightly shorter than humans, typically lasting 60-80 years without state of the art intervention from magic or medical technology. However they reach physical maturity at age 15.


Magic: Orcs have a slightly higher rate of individuals gifted with Dark magic and Summoning. They are slightly less likely to be gifted with Light magic.


Stereotypes: Orcs are often thought of as stupid. While they have no mental deficiency, orcs are less likely to have the patience for studying and academia. While there are plenty of orcs who acquire degrees they are less likely to be hired due to this stereotype.
Orcs are also often perceived as loud, violent and hot-headed. This stems from a long history in orc society of the leaders being the strongest and most boisterous. And it is true that orcs often have trouble keeping their cool, leading intimidation and violence to historically being the way to resolve disputes.


Place in civilization: Orc civilizations in the medieval era are most often martial and nomadic, most notably raiding warbands utilizing massive war wagons and chariots. As orcs supposedly came from the Astral realm of war they have been slower to settle down and exist peacefully than other species. Orcs who integrate into other societies tend to end up in martial or physical labor roles more often than not. But many orcs also gravitate towards things like art, fashion and anything else that lets them have a creative outlet and make grand displays.
The sad truth is that so many orcs seek to better their lives in integrated societies but are often rebuffed and forced to choose between menial labor and a life of crime. This is by no means universal but orcs are overrepresented in both groups.


Origin: Orcs are said to come from the Astral realm of war, likely brought here in the early antiquity by Janus, the god of the Astral. For what purpose they were brought here, is, as with most divine intervention; unknown, however Janus likely thought it brought about some sort of cosmic balance.


Trolls
Stats: 
Attributes: +4 Brawn, -1 Wits, -1 Agility, (AND an additional -1 Wits, -1 Agility racial maximum), -1 initiative
Species trait: Thick Skinned, Fast healers
Size: 6


Description: Trolls are massive mountains of muscle, typically standing between 210-260 cm, and weighing between 120-250 Kg on average. They have thick craggy skin that more resembles an animal hide and many have horns that can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They have large teeth and some even have a resemblance to orc tusks.
Trolls impressive healing factor makes them very long lived, while a troll reaches maturity at 20 they typically can live to 200 and some have reached their 3rd century. Unfortunately their fast cell growth leaves them particularly vulnerable to cancer, which cuts many of their lives shorter.


Magic: Trolls have a slightly higher rate of individuals born gifted with Nature magic. They have no particularly uncommon gift.


Stereotypes: Those of other species who spend little time around trolls may mistake them for stupid. However the truth is that they are simply slower to react. Trolls often have to act with care because their massive frame can easily cause damage. Their long lifespan and physical size have kept them from needing to act quickly in the face of threats and so they are often at odds with fast-moving urban landscapes where everyone appears to be in a hurry.
Furthermore trolls are sometimes seen as particularly aggressive or hostile but this is mostly due to them being quite territorial. It is not unusual for trolls to accost people that move through what they perceive as their territory, demanding tribute or demanding to escort them to make sure they don’t disturb anything. This stems from their ancient roles as caretakers of nature. 




Place in civilization: Troll civilizations in the medieval era consist of small tribes of trolls that care for vast tracts of land. They do their best to control animal populations and keep forest fires out of control. However their worst threats are the exploits of civilization.
In the later eras troll tribes have dwindled, many trolls have abandoned the old ways to become part of “civilization” instead of struggling against it. Furthermore exploitation of natural resources is at an all time high and always growing. The more technology grows the less the trolls can rely on their strength, size and toughness to stand up to “invaders”. Instead their territories shrink and fade away.


For those who integrate into other civilizations often find themselves pushed into the same roles of manual labor or violence-for-hire as orcs. However trolls take a longer look at life and rarely mind spending years to educate themselves or learn difficult professions. Roles near to nature such as park rangers, ecologists, or game wardens often have a particularly high number of trolls working in them. Trolls also gravitate towards security jobs and similar work where they can fulfill their sense of territoriality.


Origin: Trolls, like humans. are native to this world. It is thought that they were created by the god of Nature, Sylvanus, to look after his “garden”. Trolls have at least always claimed this and seem to have acted accordingly.
Attributes
General rules
Human attributes range from 1 to 10. A human cannot exceed 10 without the use of magic or technology. Nothing can make an attribute exceed its natural value +5 or more than twice its natural value. (Natural value means the number that has been bought at character creation and only improved with experience points)
Attribute ratings


Ratings, descriptions are based on human ability because while not all characters are human, we expect more than half of our player base to be:
0: Useless Unable to use an attribute, entirely losing the ability to move, think, express oneself or do anything but wallow in terror.
1: Feeble The most basic ability imaginable for most of these it is the approximate stat of a 4 year old human child.
2: Pitiful. This represents a level at which the attribute is useful but can barely handle basic tasks.
3: Weak, this is the ability of someone who suffers from a debilitating weakness in the attribute, such as not being fully developed.
4: Below average, This represents someone who does not use their attribute well but can handle normal usage fine.
5: Mediocre the human average, nothing impressive but not debilitating.
6: Capable, a level that comes from continued use of the attribute but without true focus or exceptionalism
7: Fit, a level that comes from hard work and focus or great genes
8: Impressive, a level that is eye-catching or impresses your surroundings when displayed.
9: Exceptional, only the most dedicated individuals with the right genes can hope to reach this level.
10: Astounding, this is the maximum for unaugmented humans. For a human this represents absolute perfection or genius. Those who can reach this level without augmentation are paragons of their respective attributes and are likely to earn renown if they keep putting it on display.
11: Awesome, In the truest sense displays on this level strike awe in the common people. It may yet be mistaken for being inside human capability until it's feats proves to be repeatable.
12-13: Inhuman, this is no longer mistaken for being human, this ability cannot be attributed to human ability anymore than a rhinoceros could.
14-15: Superhuman, this is the augmented human maximum and no humanoid species can naturally have a greater level than this, it is at a level where people may not believe it if they saw a human do it, but even in stories this seems overblown.
16-17: Unbelievable,
18-19: Unfathomable, can you picture a human predicting exactly where raindrops will fall on a football field over the course of an hour? No, it is unfathomable by human standards and yet that is the level of ability listed here.
20: Zen, there is nothing greater among humanoids, no potential unreached for this attribute, magic or technology are working with perfected flesh of a species bred for this.

Control metabolism: At Cool 12 your character can get positive effects from drugs and alcohol without all the negatives. Negative effects from drugs and poisons are halved.


Rock solid: At Cool 15 you are immune to fear effects and panic effects count merely as fear.[i] (You must still count fear effects for the purposes of stacking fears. So if you are targeted by two fear effects these cause fear in you as they would cause panic in others.) 
Derived stats


Health: Size + Brawn
Carrying capacity: Size x2 + Brawn
Willpower points = Cool
Willpower bonus = Logic/2 (round up)
Initiative bonus: Agility + Wits
Perception: Wits + Cool
Physical resistance: Brawn + Cool
Mental resistance: Logic + Cool
Dodge: Wits + Athletics
Tolerance Max: 10 (May be affected by particular Qualities)


Carrying capacity
Carrying capacity is a measure of how much your character can carry without being overburdened or distracted. It is calculated by doubling your character's Size rating and adding your Brawn.
The amount of carrying capacity taken up by an item is equal to its size. Some items are lighter or heavier than their size suggests but that is listed on the individual item, such as the tag: “light”.
Carrying capacity can be increased by wearing backpacks or other gear that helps distribute weight.
Willpower
Willpower is a measure of your character's ability to put extra effort into particular tasks. An effort that takes something out of your character not normally needed.
Willpower allows you an additional set of bonus dice to actions you choose.
No action can benefit from willpower more than once, if willpower is used to be able to perform a special action then it cannot also be used to give a bonus.
Willpower points: your maximum allowed uses of willpower and is equal to your Cool. Representing having the presence of mind to take stock of a situation before acting.
Willpower bonus: the amount of extra D6 you roll when spending a willpower is equal to your logic/2. Representing figuring out the best way to improve your chances and the strength of will to make it happen.
Taking the Initiative: You can spend a Willpower use to receive an Initiative bonus equal to your number of Willpower dice for the rest of the combat.
Alternatively you can spend a Willpower use to go first in one round regardless of initiative, does not work when surprised.
Fail Forward: A Willpower can also be spent to Succeed with a complication if the roll is only missing one Success to meet the threshold. If the player already has a complication it is upgraded one step. Narrate this as the character failing but it still somehow goes their way.
Retry: A willpower has to be spent if the character wishes to retry an action outside structured time without significant difference in their dice pool. Such as failing to pick a lock and trying again upon failure. Insufficient successes on a Retry counts as a Dramatic Failure.[j][k]
Recovering willpower: Each good nights/days rest restores one willpower point. 
Suffering a dramatic failure restores one willpower point. 
Fulfilling your “Virtue” or “Vice” can restore one or all willpower. (see. Virtue And Vice)
Additionally the GM is encouraged to give back willpower points at their discretion for funny, smart and interesting character moments. 
Initiative
Initiative does not follow the normal rules to have a pool equal to the attributes used. Nor does it count successes against a threshold. Initiative simply looks to who has the higher number on 2d6+Initiative bonus.
Initiative bonus is made up of (Agility + Wits) in combat initiative is additionally decreased by the size of the intended weapon to be used.
Final initiative: 2d6 + (Agility + Wits) - (Weapon size + other penalties such as wounds)


OPTIONAL RULE: Exceptional initiative: if one character has rolled a Final initiative that is twice as high as that of another character, the slower character loses the ability to take Reaction actions until all those who beat them by exceptional initiative have acted. 
Perception
Perception is your character's ability to notice things that are out of place or details in the environment. Perception is useful for spotting ambushes, hidden weapons and pursuers.
Perception can inform you of things that seem out of place but does not provide information to interpret it. I.e. Animal tracks may be spotted with perception but it takes a survival check to follow them as a bent branch means more to a hunter than someone who has no survival skills.
Perception is made up of (Wits + Cool) and is often the opposing dice pool for stealth checks.

Physical resistance
Physical resistance is used to resist; poison, disease, physical drugs and spells that would affect your body directly. It is also used if you wish to conceal pain or resist physical torture.
As a resistance trait Physical resistance is not penalized by “All action penalties”.
Physical resistance is made up of (Brawn + Cool)
Mental resistance
Mental resistance is used to resist; coercion, mind-affecting drugs, fear, and spells that affect your mind or perception.
As a resistance trait Mental resistance is not penalized by “All action penalties”.
Mental Resistance is made up of (Logic + Cool)
Temporary Attribute increase
Temporary Health: When Health is temporarily increased through an increase to the characters Size or Brawn; it is added in the first wound-free healthbox. Damage taken after the increase is first applied to the temporary health, with Wound Penalties and healing functioning as normal. If the health increase is removed so are the wounds they have sustained. 


Example: Orcus has 12 Health and has taken two Stun damage.
His Brawn is increased by 3 through magic, increasing his Health by the same amount.
Afterwards he takes an additional 4 stun damage. He now has 6 damage and would suffer -2 wounds if he was not an Orc.
When the spell fades Orcus removes the wounds associated with his temporary health. He now has 3 Stun Damage remaining. Were he not an orc he would now be suffering a -1 all action penalty from wounds.


Tolerance
Tolerance represents a character's ability to mentally handle unnatural increases to their abilities. At what point does someone stop feeling like themselves if they can lift cars or calculate 4 dimensional volumes in their head? Other people may start feeling like an afterthought, as if they are no longer a concern of yours, when you are so far above them. A robust sense of self is especially important to mages who already perform impossible feats that set them apart and so they suffer most from having their tolerance impacted.


Every character starts with Tolerance 10. 
It can be increased by Positive Qualities such as “Great tolerance” or “Purist”.


Tolerance Costs: Tolerance is temporarily lowered by things that increase a character's abilities. This can be Magic, Augmentations, or Drugs. 
Typically +1 to an attribute costs one Tolerance and +1 to a skill, armor or particular kind of roll costs 0.5 Tolerance. Some Augmentations have set tolerance costs.
When a character is no longer subject to the bonus such as from removing the Augmentations or no longer being subject to the spell or drug the Tolerance returns to normal.


Tolerance is only affected by things that affect your stats. A sword enhanced to pierce armor or hit body locations better will not affect tolerance. But an armor that increases the brawn of its wearer will, until taken off. Basically as long as only the item is affected and does not change your character outside the inventory it does nothing against tolerance.


Spellcasters: Your current Tolerance (maximum 10) equates the maximum rating of each of your magic skills. So if your tolerance is 7 you cannot have more than 7 ranks in any magic skill. If you already have more ranks in the skill than is allowed then it is effectively lowered until your tolerance increases. This affects both your dice pool and level of spells you can cast. It has no effect on magic specializations and you can still use Qualities that you bought even if you no longer fulfill the requirements.


The magic skill ranks return as your tolerance does.


Mental Effects: Lowered tolerance also has mental effects on your character. The lower their Tolerance the more they dissociate from the world in general and other people in particular. At lower levels you also suffer the effects from higher levels. Keep in mind that while these are the mechanical effects of lowered Tolerance you should still take Tolerance loss into account when roleplaying.


Tolerance 6: Lowered Empathy. You suffer a -2 to Empathy rolls or other Social rolls that require you to identify with another person. Additionally you don’t suffer any physical or psychological issues from seeing death or gore unless its people who are important to you.


Tolerance 4:  Minor Delusions. You start perceiving things that aren’t there. If your eyes or ears are changed then the delusions are particularly prevalent in their spectra.
At this stage the delusions are minor. The GM can mention any small detail that your character perceives as real, such as a figure watching from a window or a noise around the corner.


Tolerance 3: Emotional outbursts. You have a hard time holding back. You easily become angry, melancholic or manic.[m] Any significant emotional situation requires you to roll a mental resistance DT: (6 - Tolerance) a failure means you suffer the appropriate condition.


Tolerance 2: Super Psychosis. You are a superior specimen. All others are weak pitiful creatures. They cannot defeat you. Super Psychosis makes your character believe that they are unbeatable. They refuse to accept any loss and respond with denial and outrage. Whether it is a chess match or a combat scenario they will never accept defeat and will only retreat if they can do so feeling superior (like exiting the building they set aflame) or if they have a Lethal or Aggravated wound in one of their last 3 health boxes.


Tolerance 1: Major Delusions. You can barely register what is real anymore. Friends may look like enemies, enemies like friends, blood as confetti and a busy street as an empty verdant meadow. Any stressful situation requires you to roll a mental resistance DT: (6 - Tolerance)  a failure means that the GM dictates what you see and you accept it all as fact. This lasts until the stressful situation is resolved or calms down.




Tolerance 0: Frenzy. You risk losing control entirely. Any time you take damage you must roll a Mental Resistance DT: 4 or lose control. You must eliminate anyone and anything that COULD be a threat. That includes Enemies, Friends, passers by and animals (even caged ones). The Frenzy ends when you no longer perceive any threats.


Tolerance Negative: Risk permanent Frenzy. When you enter a frenzy. Roll 1d6. Every negative Tolerance you have counts upwards of the die. If you low equal to or below the negative then you will be stuck in a state of frenzy, even if your tolerance increases again.


Example: Orcus has gone down to -3 Tolerance. And is hit by a carelessly thrown rock. He rolls to resist but only gets 3. Its frenzy time! As he enters a frenzy he rolls 1d6… 4! That is above his negative tolerance. He is safe a little while longer…
Ratings
Skills have ranks rating from 0-10. You may receive dice-pool bonuses from specialties, magic, gear, etc. But you can never have ranks greater than 10.


0: Untrained, the character has never learned even the most basic uses of this skill. Example: Ranged weapons: never held a gun.
1: Dabbler, The character has tried to use the skills once or twice. 
Example: Medicine: a person who has taken one first aid course.
2-3: Hobbyist, The character uses this skill now and then but never has to depend on it.
Example: Craft: builds models for fun.
4: Near professional, A character who uses the skill often but lacks support or motivation.
Example: Academics: office worker/scribe who has stopped caring about their job.
5-6: Professional, A character who uses the skill daily and likely makes their living from it.
Example: Medicine: doctor at local clinic.
7: Expert, a character who follows all new developments, often has a specialty.
Example: Performance: musician who makes a good living off their music.
8: Local authority, A character who is respected/watched/consulted for their ability.
Example: Science: researcher whose work is continually published in journals.
9: Master, A character who is indisputably a master of the craft, likely best in the region.
Example: Athletics: playing for a national sports team.
10: Paragon, a character who has reached the limits of skill alone.
Example: Style: worldwide fashion icon, everything they wear is an instant trend.


Specialties
A specialty is a subset of a skill, a narrow field of study. A specialty grants +2 dice bonus for a specific use of a skill, such as throwing with Athletics. A skill can have an unlimited number of specialties but you cannot benefit from more than one at a time.
Specialties in magic skills do not give the ability to cast higher level spells. Only the skills base rating can do that… Or… you know… Blood magic…


Exotic Specialties: Certain parts of skills are unavailable to the user. A racecar driver is unlikely to perform well on horseback or in a helicopter. Therefore certain specific uses of a skill require an “Exotic Specialty”. This means that INSTEAD of receiving a +2 to the use of the skill. The Exotic specialty simply allows the character to use their full skill rating in these cases instead of it counting as untrained.


Exotic Specialties
Athletics: Weapons with “Exotic” tag.
Pilot skill: (Jet) (Rotorcraft) (Sailing). In cyber era only: (Ride)
Unarmed: Weapons with “Exotic” tag.
Ranged: Weapons with “Exotic” tag.
Melee: Weapons with “Exotic” tag.
Crafts: (Cyberware)
Science: (Hacking), ((EOD) Explosive Ordnance Disposal), Bioware
Performance: (Instrument, (String, Key, Blow, other))[n]


Extended rolls
Many skill rolls can be improved by taking it slowly. When it is reasonable, a character can take a +1 for every additional instance of time spent on a roll, to a maximum of their Cool/2. Crafting a weapon may take 1 day, the crafter can get a +1 for 2 days, +2 for 3 days etc.
Willpower on Extended rolls: If a character spends Willpower on an extended roll, they cannot regain Willpower until the roll's duration is over.
Physical
(Untrained -2)


Everyone can try physical skills. Most people have the basics in a few physical skills just by virtue of doing physical activities.
Athletics
Athletics is a physical skill that represents a character's overall ability to move, run, jump, and perform other feats of athleticism. It can be used in a wide array of situations, such as when trying to outrun an opponent, climb a wall, dodge attacks, or even perform a tricky acrobatic maneuver. Characters with a high level of Athletics are able to use their bodies to overcome obstacles and challenges with ease. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just getting started, Athletics is a vital skill for anyone looking to survive and thrive in a world full of danger and adventure.


Example uses:
* Climbing (Athletics + Brawn) Vs. Threshold
* Swimming (Athletics + Brawn) Vs. Threshold
* Gymnastics (Athletics + Agility) Vs. Threshold
* Throwing (Athletics + Agility) Vs. Defense
* Dodge (Athletics + Wits) Vs. Attack
* Lift heavy object (Athletics + Brawn) Vs. Threshold (object size-brawn)
Example Penalties:
* Slippery -2 to -6
* Bad weather -2 to -8
* Swimming: -1 for every 2 encumbrance.
Example Bonuses:
* Climbing gear +2 to +4 (climbing)
* Swimming fins +4 (Swimming)
Exotic Specialties
Athletics: Weapons with “Exotic” tag.


Melee
Melee skill is a combat skill that focuses on the use of weapons like swords, axes, and other close-combat weapons. With mastery of this skill, characters can efficiently attack foes, parry incoming attacks and use shields to deflect damage.
Example uses:
* Armed attack (Melee + Agility) Vs. Defense
* Parry (Melee + Wits) Vs. Attack
* Identify melee weapon (Melee + Logic) Vs. Threshold

Magic
What is magic?
The Gift
“Magic” is the ability to alter reality to one's will by channeling forces from other dimensions known as Astral Realms.
“The Gift” is the label used for the ability to channel magic. It bears this name because many think that the ability to channel magic power is a gift bestowed by the gods. Most Gifted are born with the gift, but it is said that it can be attained through certain rituals, bargains with Astral Entities or powerful relics. 
The most common gift is known as the “Partial” Gift, this means that the gifted can only channel magic from a single Astral Realm; Air, Dark, Earth, Illusion, Light, Nature, or Summoning.
Summoning is not actually an Astral Realm, rather it is a reference to the “in between” all the realms, it is “The” Astral.
People who have the “Complete” or “Full” Gift can learn to channel all the realms. This is far more uncommon than the partial Gift.


Limits of Magic
Magic is not limitless, to channel or “cast” magic the gifted requires multiple factors. It needs a strong connection to the Astral Realm in question as well as a strong sense of self and what one wishes to accomplish. In game these are represented by the Magic skills.
Furthermore the Gifted needs a fundamental understanding of how to achieve that which they want to accomplish. In game this is represented by a character's attributes. To change temperature one needs to have an understanding of heat and cold (Logic), to extend one's senses one needs to be used to the senses they already have (Wits) and so on.
Lastly the Gifted requires focus to shape the power as they wield it, the larger or more distant they want it, the harder it is to shape. To help them with this the Gifted typically call upon Godspeech, gestures and foci such as staves, orbs or wands that help them direct the magical energies.
Lack of focus tends


Godspeech
Godspeech is, to everyone's great surprise, the language of the Gods, and also other Astral Entities. To those without the Gift Godspeech is incomprehensible and sometimes painful to hear. But to those with the Gift see images and may even feel feelings, it is as if Godspeech sends commands to the universe to implement a script. The word for rage makes the listener feel a quick moment of rage and the word for change makes them see/experience change. Unfortunately this makes it very difficult to actually carry a conversation in Godspeech without significant practice.


In spellcasting Godspeech is a very useful tool, using it to call on an appropriate element from the astral realm they are channeling, makes it far easier to control the magical energies. It is so prevalent that using Godspeech for spellcasting is the norm rather than the exception.
Gestures
Gestures, like Godspeech, are a staple of spellcasting, it is used to steer the magical energies and used by the spellcaster to represent the effect they wish in order to keep focused on what they want.




Basic rules
1. Magic cannot create something out of nothing. But can drastically alter things that exist.
2. Magic cannot bestow permanent bonuses without sacrifice.
3. Magic cannot directly affect anything outside the caster's line of sight. But can be sustained after no longer remaining in line of sight. It can have effects outside line of sight such as a fireball hurting someone behind a corner.
4. Concentration cannot be maintained while unconscious or without presence of mind.


Spellcasting
To cast a spell, just like with any skill, you roll the magic Skill + Attribute. The skill used is dependent on what magical skill you are casting from, i.e. a “Dark” spell uses the “Dark” Magical skill. The attribute used varies with the particular effect/spell you are looking to create, see “spellcasting attribute”[ax]

Spell threshold
Spells may have a threshold set by the opposing resistance or defense roll if it targets an unwilling living being. However spells also have a secondary threshold. Unlike normal thresholds this does not determine a spell's success or failure, though it may offer positive outcomes such as Critical successes when no other threshold is applicable. What it does is determine if the caster suffers a mental backlash from being unable to contain the power of the spell.
The secondary threshold is: (Spell level/2 rounded up). If the caster fails to meet the threshold he suffers the difference in stun damage. This damage is resistant.


Example. Casting a level 3 spell has a secondary threshold of 2 (3/2, rounded up). If the caster only gets one success they suffer 1 stun damage, but it does not necessarily mean that the spell fails.
Spell terms
Sustained: spells that are sustained require the caster to keep the spell maintained through concentration. Every spell that a caster maintains inflicts a -2 all action penalty.
A sustained Area spell can be moved with a complex action at the rate of 2 moves per round.
Target: this indicates what can be directly affected by the spell such as: 
Element: (fire, lightning, ambient heat), 
Object: physical, non-living object, 
Being: living/unliving creature, person.
Effect: target an effect brought on by magic; a curse, a barrier, etc.
Area: this indicates if the spell can or will affect an area.
Possible: caster can choose to affect an area, 
No: targets have to be affected individually, 
Yes: the nature of the spell means it always affects an area.
Tolerance: does this spell's effects modify tolerance? 
No: they do not, 
Yes: only affects tolerance if the effects of the spell benefit the target.
Attribute: designates the attribute used with the skill for the spellcasting test.
Resistance: how the other person resists you, a character can choose not to resist.
        No: There is no resistance, unless the target is unwilling.
Size[ay][az]: mostly comes from affecting objects, 
Defense: the target may dodge (or sometimes parry) your spell like an attack. Physical: target resists with brawn + Cool, 
Mental: target resists with logic + Cool.
Spellcasting Attribute
Brawn: spells use brawn when they make use of heavy lifting or impacts. Such as striking someone with telekinesis or similar. That a spell does damage does not mean it has to use brawn.
Agility: spells use agility when they use fine manipulation or precision targeting. Such as moving small things with telekinesis or directing a lightning bolt.
Logic: spells use logic when altering compositions, such as making armor rust or gathering ambient heat to a fireball.
Wits: spells use wits when they are about reaction or perception, such as listening in at a distance or enhancing initiative.
Power: spells use power when they seek to influence minds or trick senses, such as dominating someone, or making an illusory image.
Cool: spells use Cool when they are about enhancing resistances or keeping focus, such as shielding someone from disease or telekinetically carry something.


Some spells may allow for more than one attribute, either for different uses. Or whichever the caster prefers.


Target
Self/touch: the caster can affect themselves or a touched target at no additional cost.


Range: the caster can affect things within line of sight with an unobstructed line from the caster to target. 
Each range band beyond engaged (touch) imposes a -2 casting penalty.


Multiple targets: With a swift action caster can split their spellcasting pool in equal parts to affect several targets. It can be split as many times as the caster wishes as long as each part still has dice. All penalties and bonuses are applied before the split, the greatest penalties for range etc are applied. Each divided spell pool has to compete with the thresholds and that also means that the caster may suffer backlash for each split. [ba]


Area: if the spell can affect an area, the caster may have it affect everyone inside a zone (caster may not pick and choose targets unless specified in the spell or possesses ability to exempt targets.
Spells that would be pointless without an area, such as detection spells, start at engaged area without penalty.


Increasing spell area imposes -4 casting penalty per area size (Engaged -4, close -8, short -12, etc.) 
It also Imposes a -3 penalty to any defense roll per area size for the targets, the larger it is the harder it is to avoid. No penalty to resistance rolls however.
Area spells that do damage go against general armor and soak even if the area may cover unarmored or vital body parts.


Example: Bonnie the shaman wishes to make the dancefloor of the bar slippery while looking in from the front door. Bonnie has logic (7) + manipulate matter (6) for 13 dice.


The dance floor is at medium range imposing -6 (close -2, short -2 & medium -2) leaving Bonnie with 7 dice.


But Bonnie wants to affect the whole dance floor and makes it an area (close (-8)) leaving Bonnie with -1 die (a chance die). That's not going to Work… Bonnie may want to move closer before casting or use some equipment…
Target resistance
Every spell that affects someone or something is typically resisted in some way.


Beings: Humanoids, undead, animals and spirits.
These come in two types: Willing and Unwilling.


Willing: These are targets who chose to not resist a magical effect. This can be disastrous if they trust someone they shouldn’t. If a target is willing they do not roll anything to resist.


Unwilling: These are beings who do not willingly drop their defenses against a magical effect. They are always entitled to some sort of resistance roll, with the exception of surprised beings who would otherwise receive a defense roll.


Physical: Beings who would be directly affected by a physical malady of some sort, a disease, a degenerative curse or suffer a physical condition that would not typically be the result of a combat roll.
They roll a physical resistance trait vs. the spell and meet the number of successes achieved on the spell, in order to not be affected.


Mental: Beings who would be directly affected by a mental malady of some sort, fear, mind-reading or suffer a mental condition that would not typically be the result of a combat roll.
They roll a mental resistance trait vs. the spell and meet the number of successes achieved on the spell, in order to not be affected.




Defense: Beings who are targeted by spells- or are in the area of spells that mirror a combat roll. Such as inflicting damage and/or setting a target on fire, or tripping them.


Objects: Objects are typically split in two categories, attended and unattended. Attended objects are those that are worn, carried or watched over within an engaged area, by a being. Unattended objects are those that are not being used by anyone.


        Unattended: Unattended objects get no defense roll but resists damage as normal.
Directly affected unattended objects penalize the spellcasting roll by their size (or armor if that is more fitting for the spell effect.


Attended: Attended objects use the defense of the wearer and may require a targeted attack with the spell. Directly affecting an attended object is resisted by the wearers Cool + the object size (or armor).


Effects: There is typically no resistance for naturally occuring effects.


Magical effects: To affect magic the spell used must exceed the target’s successes on the spellcasting roll. If it is an area effect and it needs to affect the entire spell, it must take the appropriate area penalties.
Components
Movement: A caster has to use their hands in order to shape the Astral energies as they wish. This requires at least one hand free, or holding a focus.
With difficulty a caster can keep the shaping only in their mind without resorting to gestures. However this increases the spell's secondary threshold (backlash threshold) by 2.


Speech: A caster uses godspeech to command reality to bend to their will. This must be spoken with force to express the casters will. 
However it is possible to cast magic without resorting to speaking godspeech out aloud. However this increases the spell's secondary threshold (backlash threshold) by 2.


Action: A caster has to spend time and energy to form and release their arcane energies into the world. This is usually a Complex Action or can be done as a ritual taking a minimum of 1 hour.
It is possible to speed up casting in combat to a Simple Action by casting the spell “Recklessly” and skipping many of the usual steps involved in casting. Unfortunately this is more demanding of the casters skill and thus increases the spells secondary threshold (Backlash TD) by 3.


Reagents: Reagents are not necessary for normal spellcasting but can be used as an aid. They are however a requirement for things like Alchemy or making spells permanent.
Reagents can be a variety of things with thematic ties to the magical skill in question. For example reagents for Dark magic may be finger-bones, plants that grow in absolute darkness or shrouds of the dead. While Air might use particular feathers, overcharged batteries or focusing crystals. Reagents can usually be purchased or gathered by the use of the occult skill.
Reagents are always lost or made useless upon use.
Using a set of reagents when casting a spell is obvious but lowers any Backlash damage from the spell by 1.


Foci: A focus is not necessary to cast spells but they can help focus magic in particular ways. Staves and wands increase the caster's effective range, while sustaining foci help keep a spell sustain without taxing the caster.
Casting a spell can only benefit from a single focus. It is not possible to combine an orb and a staff for example. Having a sustaining Focus sustain a spell happens after casting does not count towards this limit. However multiple sustaining foci cannot be used together to sustain a single spell.
Foci are created through complex crafting requiring infusing it with reagents and adorning it with Glyphs of Godspeech.[bb]


Ritual Spellcasting
When casting spells, much as with any skill, the caster can spend extra time in order to get a bonus to the dice pool up to their cool/2. The base time for a ritual casting is 1 hour and the bonus increases each time it is added (2 hours, 3, hours etc.).


Ritual Preparation: When casting spells as a ritual it is possible to spend extra time to prepare the area in order to decrease the dice pool penalty for area effects. This involves walking the area and drawing or carving Godspeech runes.


Occult + Logic, DT: 2, 1 Hour. Net successes on this roll decrease the area penalty for the ritual spellcasting roll. 


Anchored magic (“Permanent” spells)
As magic is energy from a different Astral Realm it requires someone or something to sustain it in this world or else the gates of the Astral will slam shut and the magic will fade. Normally a caster sustains their own spells or allows a “Sustaining Focus” to function as a doorstop to keep the magic in this realm. However there are ways to “Anchor” magic in this world which means that the magic remains even if the original caster dies.


One way is to use alchemy, letting the components hold the magical charge like a battery or like the use of a key until it is released in one go or over a short period of time.


The other way is to Anchor a spell or magical effect directly in this world, essentially propping a door open indefinitely. This allows for things such as magical weapons that can burst into flame, tattoos that enhance the wearer's attributes, magical surveillance of large areas or all sorts of continuous fantastical effects.


In order to anchor a spell the caster needs to fulfill certain conditions.


Spell: to anchor a spell you need the spell itself. You make the choice whether to anchor a spell after you have cast it. Just as with sustaining you can choose to sustain it at fewer successes than you rolled but not more.
A spell that cannot be sustained cannot be anchored.
After you have anchored a spell you can no longer alter its area, targets or successes.


Anchor: a spell anchor must be a solid physical object or creature. The anchor must be marked with runes of high speech and somehow represent the effect of the spell. Ex. High speech tattoos on muscles for a Brawn increase, or an obelisk with a stylized eye for an area detection spell.


An anchor must be of a certain size in order to house the spell. The more expansive the spell the larger the object. A Critical success on the spellcasting roll can be used to lower the minimum size by 1 or 2 respectively. To a minimum of half the original size. 
If an Anchor is destroyed the spell dissipates.


* Single target effects: 
   * Weapons, Vehicles and armor: When anchoring a spell to weapons, Vehicles or armor this counts as a modification with a size cost equal to spell level/2
   * Item: The item must have a minimum size equal to spell level/2
* Dual target effects:
   * Sometimes you want to pair items, such as making a pair that allow telepathic communications between the wielders.
   * When pairing items the spell must be cast by splitting the dicepool between the targets.
   * The objects must each have a minimum size equal to spell level/2. They must also be connected, such as each carrying a half of a gem or molded from the same source. But this allows them to connect at any range in the same Astral Realm.
* Area effects:
   * To anchor an effect to an area the Anchor must remain in the area for the spell to function.
   * Base minimum size of the Anchor must be spell level/2.
   * Additionally each area size increases the minimal size by 1. So a “close area” requires an Anchor of size 2 + Spell level/2.


Sacrifice: To anchor a spell you also need a sacrifice of reagents (200c each).
* Single/dual target: 
   * The number of reagents you need to sacrifice is Spell Level x Successes.
* Area effects:
   * For area effects you need to sacrifice is (Spell Level x Successes) x 5 per area level. (5 for engaged, 10 for close, etc)
Conjunctive magic
It may be noted that not all things that exist in our world have a corresponding Magic Skill. This doesn’t mean that it cannot be affected by magic, however it does mean that it isn’t tied to an Astral Realm that is closely related to our own.


So to draw on these realms the caster needs to combine more magic skills.
In order to cast the user must have sufficient ranks in all required spellcasting skills. 


Example: Liquids are a combination of Air and Earth, in order to transform earth into water (Level 8 transformation), The caster needs 8 ranks in BOTH Air and Earth.
If the caster has different ranks in the different Magical Skills, then the Lowest is used for casting Dice Pool.

A summoned object or entity goes back to its native realm when it has filled all its health boxes. Usually a spirit can recover with enough time, just like other characters. If it takes full Aggravated damage before being sent back it is dead and can never return.

The Matrix


Terminology


Area Network: Network of Devices that uses a Terminal as a Node instead of a Comlink or Cyberdeck.


Comlink: a smart device capable of Matrix access and communications. Often serves as a Node for Personal Networks.


Cyberdeck: A portable, or implanted computer terminal made for Hacking and Matrix Security work. Often serves as a Node for Personal Networks.


Database: A collection of information that is stored on the Matrix.


Datajack: Implant to control devices via the nervous system.


Device: an electronic construction that is present in both the Matrix and Realspace.


Direct Connection: Connecting to a Device or Database Terminal via the wire of your Datajack.


Hacker (Net Runner (Slang)): Someone who uses the Matrix for illegal actions.


Intrusion Countermeasures (IC): IC is pronounced “ice”. IC are the self learning firewall programs that exist to keep Hackers out and try to fry their brains.


Matrix (The): Also known as “The Net”. The Matrix is the world spanning wireless network.


Node: The central Device of a network. Provides Programs and IC for the linked Devices.


Personal Network: Network of Devices controlled by a single person via their Comlink or Datajack.


Programs: while there are countless programs and applications that can be run on terminals, comlinks and cyberdecks, the word usually refers to resource intensive, self learning, applications that have a significant effect on a device’s capabilities.


Realspace (Slang): Hacker term for the world outside the Matrix.


Terminal: A non-portable computer, often replaces cyberdecks as a cheaper alternative in facilities.


Virtual Reality: (Cyberspace (Slang)): The Virtual Reality Matrix interface that completely envelops the user's senses and can be used for database hacking, meetings, dating, games and other online activities.


What is the Matrix?
"The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now in this very room."


From the Cyber Era the planet is spanned by an information network known as “The Matrix” or simply “The Net”. This network incorporates nearly every electronic device from lights to space shuttles. Devices use the Matrix to transmit and receive information as well as being transmitters that further the reach of the network. This means that unless a device is specifically made to be cut off from the Matrix it is online and can receive wireless commands. In an ideal world only the owners would be able to command their devices, but the world is far from ideal. 


Legal Matrix uses
The Matrix’s primary use is the collection and sharing of information but it does so much more. It is the premier way to communicate via text, audio and/or video. It allows people to have virtual interactions that span all five senses. It allows users to control electronic devices connected to their networks, such as turning lights on or off with a thought. It helps users to navigate and even allows things such as cars or drones to pilot automatically or remotely.


It is so all encompassing that Matrix access usually cannot be turned off without turning the Device off entirely. The only other option is to get inside an area that blocks off matrix access or go alone into the wilderness.


Most legal Matrix use does not require any roll from characters. Entering a Matrix chat room is very easy and so is looking up facts. These things are second nature to nearly all intelligent beings in the Cyber Era. The exceptions are illegal actions, Scanning and Matrix Research.


Matrix Research
Often the information one needs is publicly available, whether it be in public databases, on forums or social media. The trouble with accessing this information is to know where to look and to sort out the real information from the falsehoods and opinions.


Getting this information is done with the appropriate skill + Logic. Looking up legal information would use the Academics skill, Learning about a person would be Empathy, etc.


Using the Matrix grants the user a +2 bonus to research and lowers the base time to 1 hour. Of course looking up a single fact like when a historical event took place is usually only 1 minute.


Skill (research) + Logic + 2 vs. DT (1 Hour)


Virtual Reality (VR)
With a datajack and a comlink or cyberdeck a character can mentally enter the Matrix and have a virtual experience, everything from; games, chat rooms, vacations and rides can be experienced in the virtual world with enough credits.

Translation Program (Language): Translates one language to another. You can have multiple translation programs, one per language. If connected to cyberears you can hear the translation in real time. If you have cyberware to alter your voice it can translate your speech in real time.




Illegal
Black IC: Overload damage is Lethal instead of Stun. (Also applies to failed overload attempts against you.)
Bricker: Successful Overload does +1 Damage.
Co-Processor: Sustain one hack for free.
Jammer: When successfully using Disruption Quickhack against a communication device the device loses the ability to make calls or texts for as long as it is sustained. This also applies to cyberdecks on an Exceptional success.
Range Extender: Ignore -2 in range penalties.
Wide Band Transmission: Ignore -2 in area penalties.


Object Structure
Objects can typically take damage equal to Size+Armor. For electronics, most of them will have armor 3, more durable electronic items such as guns will have an armor of 4.


So a heavy pistol (size 2, armor 4) is bricked with 4 damage.


Forked Quickhack
Quickhacks can be forked to affect multiple specific targets instead of an area. The Hacking Dice Pool can be split in equal parts after applying relevant penalties, to target multiple networks or devices.


Sustained Quickhack
Some Quickhacks, such as Disrupt, and Control (see Below) can be sustained over time in order to keep the effect going. Sustaining an effect takes processing power and constant attention. Thus each sustained effect inflicts a -2 all action penalty to the Hacker.
In order to keep an effect sustained a Hacker must have their device online and remain within extreme range of the hacked device.
Quickhack rules
1. Overload, Disrupt and Control. requires the “Hacking” Exotic Specialty in “Science”.
2. Hacking devices is limited to line of sight or objects that have been “Scanned”


Quickhacking Actions
1. Scan (Simple Action)
“Find out about the thing”


2. Overload (Simple Action)
“Damage the thing”


3. Disrupt (Simple Action, Sustainable)
“Make issues for the thing”


4. Control (Complex Action, Sustainable)
“Make the thing do a thing”


Scanning
Scanning is an action performed to get information about a person, device, and the network they are connected to. If the scanner has access to appropriate scanners and networks they may also find out things such as: Their targets legal status, Ownership information, etc.


Scanning is not illegal but is often perceived as an intrusion of privacy (Similar to asking to see an ID card in the out of game world). You can be expected to be scanned when entering a bar, Store or other establishment. These scans are usually automated and only alert staff if they find something untoward.


Anyone can Scan as long as they have all the following: 
1. A comlink, terminal, or cyberdeck in their personal network. 
2. Cybereyes, Lenses, Scanners or Sensors; With the Augmented Reality feature.
* Scanning does not require the “Hacking” exotic specialty.


Scanning is a Science + Wits (Simple action) Vs. IC[ch] + Wits.


Any Net Successes reveal devices connected to the affected network. 
Impressive Success means that you are made aware of any files or programs on the devices (File titles but not their contents). 
Exceptional Success means that you know the location of the devices in realspace and can target them through walls. (However you are still subject to any range penalties.) The connection is lost when the target is outside Extreme range or turns off all their devices.


If the defender gets an Impressive Success they are aware of unauthorized scanning.
If the defender gets an Exceptional Success they know what network and physical location of the person who tried to scan them.


Overload
Overload is an action performed to ruin someone's stuff, and often their day. Overload can damage or even destroy electronics by overheating them and turning off relevant safety features. In some cases this can even harm the user if the device is implanted.


Overload requires the “Hacking” exotic specialty in science as well as a “Cyberdeck”.


Overload is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (Simple action) Vs. IC + Cool.


Any Net Successes become damage inflicted on the affected device,[ci] this damage is unaffected by the device's armor or soak. If the device is an implant and is destroyed; any excess damage is transferred to the user as stun damage, unaffected by Armor or Soak.
(A destroyed device cannot be targeted again).
Impressive success on the Overload gives the user a -2 to use the device for a combat turn.
Exceptional Success makes the user unable to use the device for a combat turn. (This also means that they cannot turn it off for that period of time.)


If the defender gets more net Successes they become aware that their devices are under attack.
If the defender gets an Impressive Success then the attacker suffers damage from the overload (but not the effects of Critical successes) equal to defenders Net Successes/2.
If the defender gets an Exceptional Success  they know the network and physical location of the person who tried to Overload them, in addition to suffering damage.


(Overload counts as an attack action for purposes of performing more actions in a turn.)


Disrupt[cj]
Disrupt is an action performed to… Well… Disrupt the use of a device. Disrupting means infecting the device with malware, which causes static, faulty readings, or error messages that makes using the device more difficult.


Disrupt requires the “Hacking” exotic specialty in science as well as a “Cyberdeck”.


Disrupt is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (Simple action) Vs. IC + Cool.


Any Net Successes become penalties to any dice roll using the device. (Cybereyes get penalties to perception and scanning, guns get penalties to shoot etc.)
This lasts for 1 combat turn unless the attacker wishes to sustain it (with the normal -2 penalty.)
Impressive Success can be used to keep the affected user unaware of the device's malfunction even after using it.
Exceptional Success can be used to make the device completely fail one roll or use. (This cannot apply to more rolls regardless of whether the Disruption is sustained.)


If the defender gets an Impressive Success they know that someone tried to disrupt their device.
If the defender gets an Exceptional Success  they know the network and physical location of the person who tried to Disrupt them, in addition the disruptor suffers half the Net Successes as a penalty to their next action with the cyberdeck.


Control
Control is an action used when you really want a different device to do something. Controlling means to supersede the commands in the device's computer with your own. This can be used to loop camera footage, make a weapon fire or drop its magazine, have a comlink send you a datafile or make an auto piloted car to turn into oncoming traffic.


Control requires the “Hacking” exotic specialty in science as well as a “Cyberdeck”.


Control is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (Complex action) Vs. IC + Cool.


Any Net Successes means that you can force the device to take a single action as if you were its user. This cannot override the physical control of a user (the car's steering wheel cannot turn if it's held by someone). If you wish the device to maintain the action you have to Sustain the matrix operation (suffering the usual -2 penalty.)[ck]
Impressive Success can be used to perform two simple actions, or simple and Swift. Instead of being limited to a single action.
Exceptional Success can be used to override a physical user (the car turns without input from the wheel, Cyberarms act on their own, devices won’t shut off even if you press the power button.)

Virtual Reality Hacking
Not all hacking targets a particular device. Often hackers seek information found in virtual databases. Highly sensitive information such as corporate secrets, identities of covert agents and other classified information is typically in air-gapped archives only accessible through select hard-wired terminals. But for other information such as hacking someone's social media, getting building plans or employees personal information is obtainable through the Matrix via Virtual Reality Hacking.


While in cyberspace, the hacker can reach databases all over the world as long as they know what to look for. Many databases have sites on the Matrix for public access even, but this is about getting to the things not readily available.


VR hacking requires a cyberdeck or terminal with matrix access as well as a datajack. While in VR the hacker is seemingly asleep; perceiving or interacting with the outside world comes at a penalty of -8. Generally getting their attention requires shouting or shaking them.


VR hacking requires far more time than Quickhacking as the hacker must constantly be updating the code of their Virtual Persona in order to protect themselves from the databases self-improving Intrusion Countermeasures.




VR Hacking Actions
1. Search (5 minutes)[cl]
“Find out about the thing”
2. Datasteal (10 Minutes)
“Download the thing”

Failing VR Hacking rolls


On a failure you take Stun Damage equal to your missing successes. (Combined with complications this damage can be Lethal).


Minor complications can mean that you leave traces behind.


A Dramatic Failure leaves you captured by the Firewall in Cyberspace until you succeed on a roll to escape. Every time you roll you will take 1 Lethal damage.
You cannot log out until you succeed on a Science (hacking) + Cool DT: Firewall rating.


Search
Often, all the Hacker really wants is information. Search is used to find information in a database. The more esoteric the data the more difficult it is to find. Search allows the Hacker to learn the information they seek but not to Download or alter the information. So this is useful if the hacker wants a simple piece of information but wont give them evidence or detailed plans to use.


Search requires the “Hacking” exotic specialty in science as well as a “Cyberdeck” and VR access.


Search parameter examples:




Search is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (5 minutes) DT: Firewall rating


Meeting the threshold gets you the information you seek.




Impressive Success can be used to get slightly more information than you were looking for.


Exceptional success can be used to give a bonus to any rolls to Datasteal or Alter Data for the relevant information equal to Net Successes/2.[cm]


Datasteal
Sometimes looking at a piece of information isn’t enough. Maybe you want it to sell, publish or show to your friends (or enemies). Then you need to bravely fish it from the depths of databases dodging malevolent Firewall in what is known as a “Datasteal”.


Datasteal requires the “Hacking” exotic specialty in science as well as a “Cyberdeck” and VR access. 
It only works if you have found the data with a search or know the approximate data you are looking for. I.e. you can target “quarterly earnings report” if it is in the database and you can guess that, but “Special Project X” probably has a completely different name and so needs to be found first.


Datasteal is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (10 minutes) DT: Firewall rating


Meeting the threshold means that the data is downloaded to your cyberdeck or datachip.


Impressive Success can be used to get some additional useful information.


Exceptional Success can be used to leave false traces; tracing the steal to a rival or make it look like an inside job.


Alter Data
What if you need to be an employee at a bank? Sure you can get hired, but isn’t it easier to just be in their list of personnel already? Or maybe you want to erase some saved surveillance footage? Then Alter Data is the action for you! Alter Data can delete or change a piece of data in a database.


Alter Data requires the “Hacking” exotic specialty in science as well as a “Cyberdeck” and VR access. 
It only works if you have found the data with a search or know the approximate data you are looking for. I.e. you can target “quarterly earnings report” if it is in the database and you can guess that, but “Special Project X” probably has a completely different name and so needs to be found with “Search” first.


Altering Data can require a second roll if you want it to show something very technical. Changing a number is easy but if you want to change something like a chemical formula while having it still make sense you may need a separate Science, Academics or crafting; forgery roll depending on what you wish to accomplish. 


Datasteal is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (10 minutes) DT: Firewall rating
Meeting the threshold means that the data is Altered or erased as intended.


Impressive Success can be used to give net successes as bonus to a forgery roll.


Exceptional Success can be used to leave false traces; tracing the steal to a rival or make it look like an inside job or have the file become corrupted next time it’s backed up.






Hacking Example
VR Hacking Example
Trilby has been hired to help a team with the Matrix portion of a heist. While the others observe the facility they need to infiltrate in realspace, Trilby decides to get what info he can from databases.


He wants: 
1. General info on some employees they can disguise as. 
2. Building Plans. 


1. Search: General Information on employees
* In this case Trilby is satisfied with learning the data. He doesn’t need a copy. So he uses search. The information type is general and so causes no penalties.
* Search is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (5 minutes) DT: Firewall rating
* Trilby has Science of: 7 and Logic of 8. 15 Dice. The Firewall rating of the Database is 4.
* 6 Successes, an impressive success! Trilby finds out basic information of the employees and their schedules. As his Critical success he asks for which ones look most like his team.
2. Datasteal: Building Plans
* Trilby wants a copy of the plans to use in planning, so he uses Datasteal. The information is Restricted so he suffers a -4. A Significant difficulty. Trilby decides to take his time. 240 minutes nets him a +4. Enough to counter the penalty.
* Datasteal is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (10 minutes) DT: Firewall rating
* Trilby has a Science of: 7 and Logic of 6. 13 Dice. The Firewall of the database is 4.
* 5 successes. It is enough but no Critical success. Trilby brings the plans to his team so they can prepare accordingly.
Quickhacking Example
While infiltrating the facility Trilbys team needs to sneak past a camera. Preferably unnoticed. Later they encounter a locked security door he needs to open.


1. Disrupt: Camera
* Trilby just needs the camera to miss his team. Disrupting the optics for a few seconds should be enough. The camera is at medium range, so Trilby will suffer a -2.
* Disrupt is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (Simple action) Vs. IC + Cool.
* Trilbys has a Science of: 7 and Logic of 8. 13 dice with the -2. The opposing network has an Firewall of 6 and the guard in control has a Cool of:6
* Trilby rolls 13 dice: 3 successes and a minor complication. The guard rolls 12 dice for the camera: 7 Successes!!! An exceptional defense!
* Trilbys physical location is revealed to the guard. No more time for stealth. And Trilby will suffer -2 to his next matrix action. The minor complication is used to raise this to -3.
2. Control: Door
* The rest of the team are keeping the guards in place with firepower waiting for Trilby to open the door. To minimize his risk of failure Trilby connects directly to the keycard reader for the door. This gives him a +3, which cancels out the penalty from his last failed hack. Not wishing to repeat his failure Trilby also spends a willpower point for +4 (logic 8/2)
* Control is a Science (Hacking) + Logic (Complex action) Vs. IC + Cool.
* Trilby has a Science of 7 and Logic of 6. +4 for the Willpower point. 17 Dice.
* The guard still has an IC of: 6 and Cool of: 6. 12 Dice.
* Trilby rolls: 6 Successes. The guard rolls: 3 Successes. Trillby gets an exceptional success!
* He uses the exceptional success to have the door to jam when it next closes. After he and his team are through he lets the door close and jam behind them. He has bought them some time…
Combat
Combat takes place in “Structured Time” meaning that characters each have a limited time to act. Combat is divided into “Rounds” each participant gets to act during each round. They act on their “turn” determined by their “initiative order”.


Rounds are not meant to have an exact time constraint in order to make the action more cinematic. If a time is specified then the argument will always be made that someone could do more or less than their character or that a round has passed because someone spoke for more than a few seconds. That said a round is meant to be roughly 6 seconds.
Actions
Actions: every character has a few actions available to them during a round of combat. 1 complex action OR 2 simple actions, 1 swift action and as many free actions as the gm wishes to allow (minimum 1) any action may be replaced by a lower action, i.e. you may trade a simple action for another swift,
After you have moved you cannot take another action and then keep moving. You may not split movement around actions.


You may not take any action twice in a turn even if you have the actions remaining.
* Aiming is explicitly exempt from this rule.


You may not perform more than one attack action per turn even if one is physical and the other magic.
Complex actions:
Draw large/concealed weapon
Fully automatic fire
Suppressive fire
Spellcasting
Grapple
Area attack (close combat)
Charge (cannot be used with move, swift action)
Use skill
Full defense
Ready Action
Safe disengage


Simple actions:


Close combat Attack action
Single or burst fire
Reckless casting
Give command (to subservient npcs, drones, summons etc)
Escape grapple
Withdraw from engagement 
Run
Aim
Draw weapon
Reload
Stand up
Observe in detail (perception check)


Swift actions
Move
Take cover (nearby)
Go prone 
Declare Spell defense
Shielding magic
Quickdraw
Called shot


Free actions
Drop held object
Stop sustaining spell
Speak (short statements, no social skill use)


Attack and defense actions
Attacker declares attack
Defender declares
Athletics + wits to dodge[cn]
Or
Melee + wits to parry
When a parry is initiated the one with smaller weapon size is penalized the size difference.


Ranged attacks cannot be blocked unless defender has a shield, 
Ranged attackers have to take a penalty based on optimal range. Every rangeband away from optimal gives -2.
Defender may add shield size to defense when blocking.
A defender with an equipped projectile ranged weapon may use it to parry a close combat attack but the weapon only counts as half the size (rounded up).


If the attacker wins, their base damage (brawn + weapon damage) or (ranged weapon damage) is compared to defendersLethal Threshold  (armor x2 -armor piercing). If damage is higher it is lethal, if lower it is stun.


(Alternative rule: Weapon damage vs armor-armor piercing is compared for  lethality)




Then add net successes to damage and remove modified soak. The final number is damage inflicted on the defender.


Critical successes and glitches in combat


Impressive success: 
Attacker: If the attacker achieves an impressive success by beating the defenders roll by half again as many successes. 
They may choose one of the following options or one agreed by player and GM: 
1. make the attack do lethal damage even if the Lethal Threshold is too high.
2. Inflict a minor negative condition on the target.
Defender: If the defender achieves an impressive success by beating the attackers roll by half again as many successes. 
They may choose one of the following options or one agreed by player and GM: 
1. Take a minor beneficial condition
2. Inflict a minor negative condition on the attacker.


Exceptional success: 
Attacker: If the attacker achieves an exceptional success (critical hit) by beating the defenders roll by twice as many successes. 
They may choose one of the following options or one agreed by player and GM: 
1. Ignore all targets armor rating (but not soak granted by brawn) 
2. Inflict a major negative condition on the defender.
Defender: If the defender achieves an exceptional success by beating the attackers roll by twice as many successes. 
They may choose one of the following options or one agreed by player and GM: 
1. Take a major beneficial condition
2. Do damage to the attacker equal to net successes.




Minor complication: 
Attacker:
Major Complication: 
Dramatic Failure:[co]


Complex actions:




Draw large/concealed weapon
* A weapon that requires two hands to operate and/or is carried on the back, typically size 4 and larger. As well as weapons that are concealed in inside pockets or calf holsters. Require a complex action to draw and cannot be quick-drawn. So many fighters with large weapons also carry something smaller for quick access.
 
Fully automatic fire
* Using full auto (with capable weapons) gives defenders a -3 defense penalty and targets all who are in the same engagement.
It takes 10 bullets. Additionally the brawn requirement for wielding the weapon is doubled when using full auto and the attacker cannot combine this with called shots.


Safe Withdraw
* You can extract yourself from a hostile engagement without risking attacks. You end up in close range of the opponent, you can use move as a swift action to move further.
This way to disengage is safe but leaves you open to quickly be reengaged.


Semi-Automatic Burst
* By taking a complex action with a semi automatic weapon you can simulate a burst.
As a normal burst it gives the defender -2 to their defense and takes 3 bullets.


Suppressive fire
* Using suppressive fire forces everyone in the targeted zone to be forced to drop prone or take full cover. This uses up their next swift action if they are not already prone or in cover. Anyone who refuses will suffer an attack. These attacks only ever do base damage, net successes are not added, nor can suppressive fire receive a Critical success.
Successes on suppressive fire gives an equivalent penalty to all active actions taken inside the target zone until the suppressor's next action.
Suppressive fire can only be done with an automatic or semi automatic firearm. Semi automatic suppression takes 10 bullets, automatic suppression takes 20 bullets but those attacked suffer the -6 auto penalty to defense.




Spellcasting
* Caster declares what spell they wish to cast, the spell's force and the target(s). Before rolling the roll receives bonuses and penalties based on foci, components, range, area and targets. Then the caster rolls the spell specified attribute + magic skill. Attack spells are defended against as normal, or resisted with physical or mental resistance.


Grapple
* A grapple is initiated with an Unarmed + Agility test vs. Defense. If the attacker wins the test both participants suffer the grappled condition. After the grapple has been established both parties roll a "grapple check" brawn + unarmed. Or if a party only cares to escape the grapple they may utilize agility + athletics instead.
The opposed grapple check is then repeated each following round on the highest initiative of any grapple participant.
When a party wins they may take one of several options.
* Pin: the pinned character cannot take any non-free action except trying to escape the pin, or spellcasting without movement. A pinning participant can keep making other grapple maneuvers on subsequent rounds but leaving the grapple also means ending the pin.
   * A pinning character can take outward actions such as shooting a gun at others, while maintaining the pin. They suffer a -3 penalty to both the action and the grapple roll and cannot do anything in the grapple other than maintain the Pin. The roll to affect the outside comes after the grapple roll and only on their initiative.
* Takedown: the one who performed this maneuver can either knock the opponent prone and remain standing; ending the grapple. Or follow along making them both count as prone to those outside the grapple but between them only the bottom one will suffer penalties of the prone condition.
* Injure: the winner does damage as a successful attack. Either unarmed or with a held weapon of size 2 or smaller.
* Forced move: the winner can raise the grapple up from prone, if they are already standing they can instead move the grapple as far as one move allows.
* Draw weapon: maximum size 2.
* Disarm, successful disarm means the winner now controls the weapon.
* Apply restraints: as long as the grappler has rope, manacles or other restraints drawn they may use a maneuver to apply them, however, to apply the restraint they must succeed on this action once for every limb they wish to restrain. And these must be done consecutively i.e. performing this action only to lose the next grapple check requires starting over. (Except for restraints with "quick lock" quality)
* Escape grapple.




Multiple grapplers:  if an ally wishes to take part in a grapple then they can do brawn + unarmed as a teamwork test. However they become a valid target for grapple actions.




Spellcasting in grapple:
A character who wishes to cast a spell in a grapple must either: 
Establish a pin, in which case they can cast with -3. 
Or
Forego their grapple check and be unable to use gestures in casting.
If they choose this the grapple is resolved first and they act on their initiative.
	





Area attack (close combat)
* By using a complex action a combatant may sweep their weapon or limb in a wide arch hitting multiple opponents. As long as all targets are within engaged distance to one another the attacker can affect a number of targets equal to half weapon size + 1 additional target for attackers size above 5. So a troll (size 6) with a two-handed sword (size 4) could affect 3 targets. However it is not possible to pick and choose what targets to affect in the area.
performing an area attack is done with a -4 penalty and if any blocker gets a Critical success they can use it to halt your swing before affecting others.


Additionally area attack can be done instead of the normal attack penalties if the target is invisible.


Charge (cannot be used with the move swift action)
* Charge allows a character to move from short range and into engaged and make a close combat attack. A charge has to be in a straight line, and cannot be done over difficult terrain. A charging character gets +2 on their close combat check but suffers -2 to defense until their next turn.


Use skill
* Many skills have a use in combat without falling under attack or “observe in detail”.
* Picking a lock, giving an inspiring speech, intimidating the enemy, climbing, driving, and many more.


Full defense
* A character may choose to hunker down and focus on defense instead of attacking. A character taking full defense receives a bonus to all defensive actions equal to their Cool stat.
A character who has not yet acted, and is not surprised may declare that they are taking a full defense action before it is their turn to act.
Taking full defense can be a great way to improve your chances later in combat since you are much more likely to get a Critical success on your defense rolls, allowing you to inflict conditions.


Ready Action
* A character may choose to prepare an action instead of acting immediately. You can choose any one action up to a complex action to be performed when certain conditions are met as a reaction. You must set simple and observable conditions such as “as soon as someone enters the room” and an action you can perform such as “I will shoot the person who enters”.
This action remains in place until you take a different action or lose the ability to perform it. The GM may permit you to take certain fitting actions such as aim actions if you plan to shoot a particular place or an intimidation. But they have to occur on subsequent turns as normal.
Simple actions:


Close combat attack action
* Attacking is at the core of combat. It requires the attacker to be in engaged range with the defender. One attack isn't necessarily one hack, slash, stab or punch but rather a quick back and forth between the combatants.
A close combat attack consists of Agility + Melee or Unarmed.


Throw attack action
* Throwing can be done with any weapon with the tag “throwing”, throwing a weapon not meant for it normally counts as an improvised weapon.
A throw attack action consists of Agility + Athletics


Single or burst fire
* Attacking with a ranged weapon. Most older range weapons can only fire a single shot per attack. Some modern weapons are capable of burst fire, or fully automatic, both of which can fire a 3 round burst as a single round.
A ranged attack action consists of Agility + Ranged weapons for projectile weapons and Agility + Athletics for throwing.
Burst applies -2 to the target's defense roll.


Reckless casting
* Releckless casting allows a caster to cast spells faster than normal, making it possible to perform another action during the round. Reckless casting comes with a cost. It increases the spell's secondary threshold (backlash threshold) by 3.
You still cannot cast two spells per round or attack and use an attack spell both.


Give command (subservient npcs, drones, summons etc)
* Sometimes a character needs beings or machines to do what they say. Giving a simple command to all is a simple action. Such as: “Kill the ones in white” or to change an order: “Actually, capture the elf!” 


Escape grapple
* Instead of taking a complex action to try to win a grapple check, you can try to slip out of the grapple using an agility + athletics check. If you win you can only escape the grapple as a simple action. If you do not then you remain stuck in the grapple.
If a character has escaped grapple prior to their turn, their other actions will be delayed until it is their turn.


Withdraw/Close in
* Withdraw: Maybe a close combat engagement is not for you. However, turning and running is a good way to be stabbed to death. So you need to try to extricate yourself from combat. 
This can be done with an Agility + Athletics roll. It is opposed by the other combatant(s) close combat rolls (reach is not a concern in these rolls). 
If you get any net successes you can withdraw into close range, if they score a grazing hit you are stuck in the engagement but take no damage, if they score net hits then you stay in combat and take damage as if they had done a successful attack. 
* Close in: similarly, if you find yourself outclassed by your opponents reach you can close in. That means stepping inside their guard. It is a very risky move but can be vital if the enemy has a spear and you a dagger. You can only be “closed in” with one combatant at the time. You can leave closed in with a successful withdraw check or it can end if one combatant is moved forcefully or grappled.
Make an Agility + athletics roll (- opponents full reach).  It is opposed by the other combatant’s close combat/unarmed rolls. If you get any net successes you can close in and neither combatant can use or benefit any weapon over size 2, if they score a grazing hit you are stuck in the engagement but take no damage, if they score net hits then you stay in combat and take damage as if they had done a successful attack.


Run
* If the move swift action is not sufficient you can go into running for another move. Running gives you -4 to all actions, except non-attack athletics checks, until your next turn. Additionally all ranged attacks against you suffer a -2.


Aim
* You can “aim” using any weapon, this can be described as looking through a scope and holding your breath or sizing up your opponents defense or making light probing attacks that will never really hit to see the openings.
Regardless of how it is described, aim gives the user +1 to their next attack roll against the intended target (or target in the same position), this can be done for a number of simple actions up to the aimer's Cool/2.
Aim is excepted from the rule to not perform the same action twice in a turn.
In close combat, if the target of the aim action stops being engaged with the aimer for any reason, the aim bonus is lost.
In ranged combat, if the target of the aim action disappears out of sight the aim bonus is lost.
Similarly if the aimer takes any active action other than aiming or attacking their aimed target they lose the aim bonus.
 
Draw weapon
* Draw a weapon that requires one hand to operate and/or is carried on the hip or in front, typically size 3 and Smaller. Weapons that are concealed in inside pockets or calf holsters require a complex action to draw and cannot be quick-drawn. So many fighters with large weapons also carry something smaller for quick access.


Reload
* Inserting a new magazine into a gun or putting a new arrow on the bow. Weapons with the Slow reload trait require more than a simple action. Keep in mind that crossbows and bows have to be reloaded after being drawn as they cannot be carried loaded.


Stand up
* Standing up from a prone or sitting position.


Observe in detail (perception check)
* Sometimes you wish to take a moment to try to perceive a combatant or something to grab as a weapon. Unlike most other skill uses you can do this as a simple action.


Pick up Object
* Picking up something from the ground is a simple action as long as it does not require a skill check.


Open door
* Opening doors, windows, and other unlocked objects can be done as a simple action.
Swift actions
Move
* Moving fast but not at full tilt, you can use move to move inside a range band or to a different zone. Further travel may require use of move on subsequent turns or taking the run action.


Take cover (nearby)
* Taking cover allows you to get yourself into cover as long as it is nearby (and inside close range). You may choose how much cover you wish depends on how much is available. Typically an object can offer cover roughly equal to its size or one step less for oversized characters.
Light: +2 to defense covered characters with ranged weapons. Character covers roughly 50% of their body ((typically requires at least an object of character size -1. Example, car door)
Medium: +4 to defense covered characters with ranged weapons. Character covers roughly 75% of their body.((typically requires at least an object of character size. Example, tower shield or the hood of a car)
Heavy: +6 to defense covered characters with ranged weapons. Character covers roughly 90% of their body (typically requires at least an object of character size +1. example building wall with arrow slit)
Full: must shoot through cover to hit covered character. Characters cover 100% of their body. ((typically requires at least an object of character size +2. Example, wall, train)
Reaction: This swift action can be performed outside your turn as long as you are not surprised or distracted and have a swift action to spend.


Go prone 
* Throwing yourself to the ground. Usually to avoid suppressive fire or other incoming projectiles. After taking this action you suffer the Prone condition until you stand up.
Reaction:[cp] This swift action can be performed outside your turn as long as you are not surprised and have a swift action to spend.




Quickdraw
* Draw a weapon quickly that requires one hand to operate and/or is carried on the hip or in front, typically size 3 and Smaller. (Character size -2)
In order to quickdraw a weapon you must have a wits of 2x the weapon size. (i.e.  an arming sword (size 3) requires wits 6 to quickdraw.)
Weapons that are concealed in inside pockets or calf holsters require a complex action to draw and cannot be quick-drawn. So many fighters with large weapons also carry something smaller for quick access.


Called shot
* If you wish to target a specific body part (or piece of equipment) in close or ranged combat you must spend a swift action to declare that you are doing a called shot.
In melee you suffer a -2 per size difference of the used weapon and the target. The smaller the weapon the easier it is to hit a specific point.[cq][cr][cs]
In ranged combat the size of your weapons have no bearing on accuracy so instead a called shot in ranged combat suffers -2 per size below 5 it targets.
* Trip: -4, -8 if the target has 4+ legs.
* Disarm: -4, -8 if the target is holding the weapon/item in 2 hands.
* Target Vitals: -4, 2 more damage. A simple aim for a more painful spot.
* Damage equipment: (see barriers[ct].)
Area Attacks do not count as called shot even though they may theoretically cover specific body parts that are vital or unarmored.


* Body parts: for Size 5:
* 4: Torso -2, 
* 3: Leg -4, (Leg wrack, Disabled Leg)
* 2: Arm/Head -6, (Arm wrack, Disabled Arm / Stunned)
* 1: -8 Hand/Face/Heart/Throat, 
* Vital spot: (Heart or Throat: Stun damage does Lethal, Lethal ignores half soak from Brawn) 
Heart damage = Gaping wounds Condition. (Page reference)[cu]
Throat damage = Choking Condition. (Page reference)[cv]
* 0: -10 Eye/mouth, (Lethal to eye ignores half soak from Brawn)
Eye Damage = Partially blinded. (Page reference)[cw]


Split attack
* A character who is unarmed or wielding two weapons can split their attack dice pool as a swift action in order to strike multiple targets or strike the same target twice.
The character can use different types of weapons in each hand, such as a pistol and a knife. When that is the case the lower dice pool and the greatest penalties are applied.
When calculating the pool penalties apply before the split but you have to use the highest penalties of the targets.
Then split the pool as evenly as possible between targets.
Free actions
Drop held object
* Simply letting an object go with barely any input on where it falls. May break fragile items like glass.


Stop sustaining spell
* The spell simply disappears, any remaining effects, like if the spell has set something on fire, that fire remains.


Speak (short statements, no social skill use)
* Saying things like, get him! or Don't shoot!
Initiative order[cx]
Initiative: at the beginning of each round every participant rolls 2d6 and add rating of wits+agility-(size of weapon, item or magical foci the character plans to use). Other things may also affect Initiative, such as armor, and any wound penalties.
This is just to get a number, not successes. Characters act in order of decreasing initiative.
Two weapons or weapon and shield: When planning to use two items for defense or attack during a round the initiative penalty is equal to the greatest penalty item and half (rounded up) of the lower penalty item.
Ties technically means that two characters act at the same time, however resolve it as follows: PAWR
PC goes first, if both are PCs: Character with higher 
Agility, if same then character with higher 
Wits then 
Roll 2d6 each until one gets a higher number.


Surprise 
If one party catches the other unaware they are allowed one action up to a complex before combat starts and initiative is rolled.
If part of a party fails to surprise, only the successful ones are permitted the extra action.
A character may not apply their defense against a character of which they are unaware.

Barriers

Structure: an object's “health”, known as its “structure rating” is equal to its size + armor rating. A wall is typically size 8-12 depending on how big, In addition when trying to get through a wall. Each layer of the typical thickness adds half again as much size and armor to the structure rating. I.e. a house wall of brick Structure: 12 (Size: 10, armor: 2) that has two layers of brick has a structure of 18 (Size:10 +5, armor: 2+1) In order to increase again the wall needs to increase in size again to three layers.


Soak: when damaging an object directly rather than trying to pierce it (such as with armor) it has a soak value of armor x2.


Armor: This is the value added to any target behind cover when trying to shoot through the material.


Damaging objects: In order to damage an object a weapon's damage must have a base damage value (or brawn + damage) greater than the object's soak - Armor piercing.
Objects with armor value >0 can only be damaged with weapons that do Lethal damage.


Attacking through objects: To pierce a barrier the weapon used has to be able to damage it (see damaging objects above). If it can then the attack proceeds as normal with the target adding the barriers armor (not doubled) to their soak. A pierced object suffers 1 structure damage.

Combat Example


Orcus the orc is about to fight two shifty eyed halflings.


Orcus has: 
brawn 9, 
Agility 6, 
Wits: 5
Melee: 7 (9 with specialty Axes)
and he will be wielding his glorious greataxe size: 4, damage +4


He tries to sneak up on the halflings but they spot him!


It is time for initiative!
The halflings have 
brawn 4, 
Agility 7, 
Wits: 6
Weaponry: 4 
and will be wielding short swords size: 2, damage +2, or light crossbows, size: 3, damage 13.


Orcus rolls a 3 and a 6 + 11 (agility 6, wits 5) -4 for the slowness of his axe for a total of 16


Halfling 1 rolls two 5s + 13 (agility 7, wits 6) -2 for the short sword for a total of 21


Halfling 2 rolls 2 6s for a total of 23.


Both halflings act before Orcus


Halfling 2 draws his shortsword (simple action), moves up to Orcus (swift action) and stabs (simple action) While saying “DIE TUSKER!” (free action)


Halfling 2 rolls agility (7) + Weaponry (4) with -3 for Orcus superior reach (2 for weapon difference, 1 for character size difference) 8 dice, (6+1+3+3+3+3+5+4) two successes and no complication.


Orcus choses to parry, his weapon is already drawn from his failed ambush attempt, wits (5) + weaponry (9), no penalties, 14 dice (5+3+4+4+1+3+2+6+1+3+6+3+5+6)=5 Successes, no complications.


Orcus beat the halfling by 3 which is twice as much as the halfling got, he had an exceptional defense! GM and Orcus agree that orcus can get the positive condition “in cover” from the halfling as he manages to keep him between Orcus and his companion. In this case his cover bonus will be 4 (the halflings size)


Halfling 1, pulls his crossbow (simple action) and loads (simple action), the gm points out that he did not take the penalty from the crossbow, if the halfling had fired this round he would suffer -1 for essentially moving too fast for comfort, but now he’s not rolling any dice.


Orcus’ turn. Orcus decides to use an aim action for +1 to his next attack (simple action) then proceeds to swing at Halfling 2 (simple action) While saying “I’d cut you in two, but the pieces would be too small!” (free action)


Orcus rolls agility (6) + weaponry (9) -1 for small target +1 for aim. 15 dice. (1+3+1+6+2+2+5+6+5+1+4+2+6+2+3)=5 Successes again! three 1s means no complications.


Halfling 2 decides to dodge, and rolls wits (6) + athletics (6) (dodging does not account for reach). 12 dice. (1+5+5+2+5+2+6+3+1+2+4+1)=4 Successes, three 1s means no complications.


Orcus having achieved 1 net success gets to inflict damage. Orcus base damage is 13 (9 brawn + 4 greataxe damage) The halfling has a soak of 5 (4 brawn + 1 leather armor) orcus’ is higher so it will be lethal damage. Then orcus adds his +1 from net successes to his base 13 =14 damage. This is reduced by the halflings soak (5) for a final damage of 9!
The halfling has a maximum health of size (4) + brawn (4) for a total of 8. Meaning that the halfling fills his entire track of lethal damage and the one overflow becomes aggravated damage. The halfling is unconscious and will bleed out in 7 minutes.


Laughing Orcus uses his swift action to move up to the other halfling. He is fortunate that it did not move further away.


New round! Means new initiative!


Orcus rolls (6+4)+11(agility 6, wits 5) -4 for the slowness of his axe for a total of 17.


Halfling 1 will stick with his crossbow and so rolls 1+2 +10 (agility 7, wits 6) -3 for crossbow for a total of 13.


Orcus goes first. Laughing at the little crossbowman he aims for +1 (simple action) and strikes (simple action)


Orcus rolls agility (6) + weaponry (9) -1 for small target +1 for aim. 15 dice. (3+5+3+4+4+4+5+2+1+4+3+5+6+3+2)=4 Successes


Halfling 1 decides to dodge, and rolls wits (6) + athletics (6) no penalty for inferior reach. 12 dice. (1+2+6+6+3+6+5+4+1+2+3+1)=4 Successes (no complication)


A tie means that the hit is grazing and a tear is ripped in the halflings clothing but he takes no damage.


Then it is Halfling 1s turn. If he attempts to shoot while engaged in melee he will suffer -3 for the size of his crossbow and an additional -2 for not optimal range for a total of -5. This seems too likely to fail so he decides to try to withdraw before firing.


He does a withdraw action. He rolls agility (7) + athletics (6) 13 dice 
(3+1+1+3+5+2+2+4+6+6+4+5+1)=4 Successes


To oppose him Orcus gets to roll an attack roll with no consideration for reach. Orcus rolls agility (6) + weaponry (9) -1 for small target. 14 dice (2+5+1+6+5+3+4+2+5+3+2+1+4+2)=4 Successes


Orcus ties with the halfling which means that it fails to escape the engagement but suffers no damage.
Halfling 1 cannot try to withdraw again since you cannot do the same action twice in a round so he chooses to try to shoot while engaged. (simple action)
Agility (7) + ranged weapons (4) -5 (-3 for the size of his crossbow and an additional -2 for not optimal range) 6 dice. (1+1+5+1+3+3)=1 Success, but 3 1s which is half his dice pool = major complication. Complication does not stop the attack from happening with 1 success, but the complication should be resolved before Orcus’ defense roll. The GM decides that the crossbows string breaks rendering it useless after the shot goes off.


Orcus wishes to parry the crossbow. Normally he cannot parry ranged weapons but it is possible when it is used in melee as Orcus would be close enough to smack the weapon away. Still no regard is given to reach as the crossbow is ranged.


To parry orcus rolls: wits (5) + weaponry (9), no penalties, 14 dice (3+2+2+6+6+1+3+1+5+6+5+1+6+2)=6 Successes, Exceptional success: Orcus did not only get double the Halflings successes but 5 times!


Orcus requests that as he smashes the crossbow aside he also manages to slash the Halflings weapon belt. The GM agrees, the belt with its weapon is caught on the axe and flies several meters away.


Disarmed and alone the halfling begs Orcus to spare his life. Combat ends.






Health and Healing
Health
Health is a measure of how much physical punishment your character can take. It is a combination of their Size and their Brawn.
Each point of health is represented by a box on the Health Track. To track damage to your health you fill in boxes equal to damage taken (wounds). The health track is always filled in with the most severe wound type to the left and less severe to the right.
So a character's health track starts with any aggravated wounds, then Lethal and lastly Stun.


Wounds
Wound penalty: Every 3 filled boxes gives a -1 all action penalty. 
Wounds can be:


Stun: represented by a / (slash) through the box. This represents bruising, light bleeding and similar wounds, normally gained through being hit with non-lethal weapons or doing poorly on a spell.
* When all your character’s boxes have at least one Stun wound [/] in them you must roll (Cool, threshold: 2)  to stay awake. Failing a roll means your character is unconscious until they recover at least 1 stun wound.


Lethal: represented by a X (cross) through the box. This represents cuts, broken bones, heavy bleeding, electrocution, burns and similar wounds. Most often gained from dangerous elements, armed enemies or clawed creatures.
* When all your character’s boxes have at least one Lethal wound [X] in them you fall unconscious and start to bleed out. You will take one Lethal Damage per minute (upgrades to Aggravated wounds) until you have full Aggravated wounds and die or receive first aid. (Medicine + logic, Threshold: 2)


Aggravated: Represented by an ✳ (Crossed X) through the box. This represents grievous wounds to your character such as lost limbs, (near) fatal blood loss, pierced organs or supernatural injuries. Most often gained from taking more lethal wounds than the body can handle or through powerful magic.
* When all your character’s boxes have at least one Aggravated wound, they are dead.


Upgrading: When your health track is full of damage, further damage of the same severity upgrades to the next level. With full stun damage and you take an additional stun you now have 1 lethal wound and the rest are stun. If you instead take one lethal damage this simply replaces one stun with Lethal.
Healing[da][db]
A character always heals the least grievous wounds first. Just as wounds are applied left to right in order of severity they are healed in the opposite order of right to left.


Natural healing: A character rolls their Brawn for every healing interval. They heal one of the corresponding wounds per success.
Resting: The listed intervals assume that the character remains active. Training, working or going about their business. If they rest, taking part in no physical or magical activity then they heal at half the interval.
Stun: Stun damage has a healing interval of 1 hour if active.[dc][dd][de]
Lethal: Lethal damage has a healing interval of 2 days (48 hours) if active.
Aggravated: Aggravated damage has a healing interval of 7 days (168 hours) if active  [df][dg][dh]


Example Healing Complications: Complications will occur often during healing rolls due to small dice pools therefore they should not be very punishing.
Stun: Minor: Bruise lasting 1 or more days. Major: A mild condition, such as “Nauseous[di]”. Dramatic Failure: Double healing interval and a mild condition.
Lethal and Aggravated: Minor: Scarring, Major: Scarring causing your character to be less attractive or easily identified. Dramatic Failure: “Infection” / “Sick” condition


Assisted healing: Someone with knowledge of medicine can assist healing in a number of ways.
First aid: First aid (1 minute per roll, Medicine + Agility (Threshold 2)) can stop a character from bleeding out, additionally any net successes can heal 1 Stun wound each. If all stun are healed then each 2 net successes heal 1 Lethal wound. Any remaining damage cannot be subject to first aid again.
For each time the time invested is doubled the skill user receives +1, 2 minutes +1, 4 minutes +2. Up to a maximum of +5.
Surgery: Surgery (1 hour per roll, Medicine + Agility (Threshold 4) can be used to downgrade 1 Aggravated wound + 1 Aggravated wound per net success to Lethal wounds. Any remaining damage cannot be subject to Surgery again.
For each time the time invested is doubled the skill user receives +1, 2 hours +1, 4 hours +2. Up to a maximum of +5.
Long term care: Long term care can be used to teamwork the wounded individual’s Lethal or Aggravated healing roll. The carer needs to spend at least 2 hours per day caring for the individual, divided throughout the day. Therefore they can perform other activities but cannot stray far.


Environmental Hazards
The world is filled with dangers. Houses catch on fire, pollution slowly poisons the inhabitants and water presents a definitive danger of drowning.
Falling
A character takes 2 Stun damage per meter fallen, soaked only with Brawn/2. [dj][dk]If the character has time and ability to react to the fall then they are permitted an Athletics+Agility test. Each success counts the fall as 1 meter shorter. A character who takes damage from a fall ends up Prone.


Falling from a moving vehicle
If you are tossed off or bail out of a moving vehicle you suffer Stun damage equal to the vehicle's current speed x2. You soak with Brawn and armor as normal. If the character has time and ability to react to the fall then they are permitted an Athletics+Agility test. Each success removes one damage. 
If a character falls from a high moving vehicle then the Athletics test successes apply to the fall first, and any remaining successes remove damage from the speed.
Fire
Fire typically hurts more the more the body is exposed to it. Therefore the size of the fire only matters for how much of a character is in it. A person who puts a finger in a size 5 fire should still only take damage as if the fire was size 0.
Fire damage is Lethal and calculated by size + heat and applies every round. It is soaked as normal. But continuous damage may heat metal armor to lower its armor value. (GMs call)


Remember that a burning building may inflict suffocation as well as fire damage.


 
[dl][dm]
A character who is set on fire s
uffers the “On Fire!” condition.[dn][do]
HeatCandle flame /Lit cigarette: +3
Torch: +4
Campfire /Concentrated steam: +5
Housefire: +6
Forge /Propane flame: +8
Plasma torch: +9
Flaming melee weapon: = Weapon size x2 
Ranged weapon= weapon damage.
Acid
Acid is terrifying as it damages both characters and gear. A character who is exposed to acid suffers 1 damage per turn (no soak) and their armor suffers 1 structure damage per turn.


To remove the acid the exposed area must either be exposed to water or the character has to do a complex Agility + Athletics (Threshold: 3) to rub the area with sand, dust or other available material.[dp]


Exhaustion
Characters will often find themselves on the road, climbing mountains or otherwise exhausting themselves.


Typically exhaustion only matters when the characters reach a situation in which their level of exhaustion matters. There is little reason to calculate exhaustion every day of a journey if the result is simply that they will rest at the end of it. But if for example they encounter enemies or difficult obstacles along the route then it is worth knowing how tired they are.


To avoid exhaustion each character has to roll a Brawn + Athletics roll. The difficulty of this depends on what the character has been doing and how many hours they've been going.


DT 
* Riding: 1 per 2 hours
* Marching: 1 per hour.
* Quick march/tough hike 3 + 1 per hour.
* Mountain climbing: 2 per hour


Failure
1 Stun damage per lacking success.
Minor COmplication: can be used to cause the Tired condition.
Major Complication: can be used to cause the Exhausted condition. 
Pollution
Pollution is not a swift killer. Pollution slowly poisons the air, food, water and other necessities in an area. It can come from factories, forges or volcanic eruptions.
Regular pollution
When living in an area exposed to pollution a character has to make a physical resistance test: Threshold 4 every day. Take difference in stun damage. Cannot be healed until a successful day or living a day in a non-polluted area.
If someone has the Destitute lifestyle in a polluted area then the threshold is 6.


Extreme pollution
In an area exposed to extreme pollution a character has to make a physical resistance test: Threshold 4 every hour. Take difference in stun damage. Cannot be healed until a successful day or living a day in a non-polluted area.


Radioactivity
Radioactivity kills relatively slowly but functions like a plague where infected people or items carry the radioactivity with them and spread to other things or people.


Carriers: carriers spread their level of radiation (Mild/severe/deadly) to others at the same rate as it is received. I.e. A carrier of mild radiation exposes another to mild radiation every hour as long as they remain near proximity.


Radiation can be removed from characters using  Anti-radiation drugs. Carriers (people and items) have to be decontaminated with special cleaning supplies.


Items: soak radiation with (armor + radiation protection) electronics take lethal damage from radiation but others only become carriers.


When a character stops being exposed to radiation they keep taking the damage at the interval they have accrued but it does not increase.
Mild
Every hour of exposure to mild radiation causes 1 stun damage to characters and increases by 1 every additional hour. (Soaked with brawn/2 + radiation protection.) When a character starts taking actual damage (not completely soaked) they become a carrier. 
Severe
Every hour of exposure to severe radiation causes 2 stun damage to characters and increases by 2 every additional hour. (Soaked with brawn/2 + radiation protection.) When a character starts taking actual damage (not completely soaked) they become a carrier. 


Deadly
Every minute of exposure to severe radiation causes 1 stun damage to characters and increases by 1 every additional minute. (Soaked with brawn/2 + radiation protection.) When a character starts taking actual damage (not completely soaked) they become a carrier. 




Example: Orcus is visiting the  remains of an old nuclear power plant. He enters a zone of severe radiation. Fortunately a friends of his has nagged him to wear a hazmat suit (radiation protection 6) Since Orcus has a Brawn of 9 he has a radiation soak of (6+ 9/2= 11) So he can stay in the severe zone for five hours (10 damage) before he starts taking actual damage and become a carrier. However his comlink (size 1 armor 1) will start taking damage after his radiation suit is worn through (3 hours) on hour 4 the comlink will cease to function.)
Cold
Cold can be a significant or even deadly hindrance. Cold can make you shiver and unable to act properly or even give you frostbite.
Mild
Cold weather, rain, and seawater may all be mild colds.
Every hour of exposure forces a character to make a Physical Resistance (Threshold: 3). Every point of failure makes the character suffer 1 stun damage (cumulative) and -1 all action penalty (Highest applies). 
This cannot be healed until the character has had a chance to recover without the environmental effect.
Severe
Temperature below freezing.
Every hour of exposure forces a character to make a Physical Resistance (Threshold: 4). They suffer a penalty equal to the size of metal armor or metal implants that are not environmentally adapted to cold.
Every point of failure makes the character suffer 1 stun damage (cumulative) and -1 all action penalty (Highest applies). 
This cannot be healed until the character has had a chance to recover without the environmental effect.
Deadly
Polar environments, space, liquid nitrogen.
Every minute of exposure forces a character to make a Physical Resistance (Threshold: 6). They suffer a penalty equal to the size of metal armor or metal implants that are not environmentally adapted to cold.
Every point of failure makes the character suffer 1 Lethal damage (cumulative) and -1 all action penalty (Highest applies). 
This cannot be healed until the character has had a chance to recover without the environmental effect.
Heat
Mild
Every hour of exposure forces a character to make a Physical Resistance (Threshold: 3).. 
Every point of failure makes the character suffer 1 stun damage (cumulative) and -1 all action penalty (Highest applies). 
This cannot be healed until the character has had a chance to recover without the environmental effect.
Severe
Every hour of exposure forces a character to make a Physical Resistance (Threshold: 4). They suffer a penalty equal to the size of metal armor or metal implants that are not environmentally adapted to heat.
Every point of failure makes the character suffer 1 stun damage (cumulative) and -1 all action penalty (Highest applies). 
This cannot be healed until the character has had a chance to recover without the environmental effect.
Deadly
Every minute of exposure forces a character to make a Physical Resistance (Threshold: 6). They suffer a penalty equal to the size of metal armor or metal implants that are not environmentally adapted to heat.
Every point of failure makes the character suffer 1 stun damage (cumulative) and -1 all action penalty (Highest applies). 
This cannot be healed until the character has had a chance to recover without the environmental effect.
Vehicles & Chases
Vehicles
Vehicles come in all shapes and sizes. Including biological; in the form of a horse or other creature. Using a vehicle for everyday transportation, generally following speed limits etc. are very rarely reasons to involve rules. There tend to be four general situations where vehicles actually may require rolls and special rules. 
* When speed is essential and so the vehicle is operated at unsafe speeds.
* Normal operation in difficult circumstances. For these just apply the Vehicle penalties to the normal thresholds. I.e. Landing a plane may be Average (3) but with a -8 for a storm this can still be difficult. (Though a pilot usually has the assistance of a tower and co-pilot).
* Vehicles in combat.
* Chases.

Unsafe Speeds
You need to get to the hospital before your buddy bleeds out in the back. Or get to the meet before your contact gets spooked and leaves.


GMs are of course wellcome to make up their own rulings for these situations but here is a general suggestion: The threshold is set by the distance and time constraints. Without the time constraint there should be no threshold for distance and vice versa which is why this is not for normal operation. 
The pilot gets +1 per speed rating of the vehicle.[dr][ds]
These could be named the same as range bands but that seems confusing as they mean something different here.


Unsafe Speed thresholds
Distance
	Threshold
	Time constraint
	Threshold
	Nearby (within a few city blocks)
	2
	Within the hour
	+1
	Not far (same general area, like across downtown)
	4
	Tens of minutes
	+2
	Commute (over a larger city, or next village over)
	6
	Single minutes
	+3
	Road trip (different city/different state)
	8
	Every second (combat round) counts
	+5
	

Example: Orcus has to beat the police to the scene. They will be there in 15-20 minutes. 
The scene is located on the other side of Redmond. Threshold is: 6 +2= 8 Extremely difficult.
But Orcus’ Harley can do speed 4 so he gets 4 extra dice. Redmond has bad roads in the area (-2) and the tricked out Harley has a handling of +3. So Orcus is rolling with -1 to get 5 successes.
Vehicle/Drone Combat
Vehicles and drones mostly follow the rules for everything else in combat.
Initiative
* A piloted vehicle (even a horse, for simplicity) uses the driver's initiative. 
* Autonomous vehicles have 3x pilot rating[dt] + 2d6
Attacks
* A moving vehicle gives any occupant -4 to ranged attacks. Or -2 to melee attacks.
* A moving vehicle with built in weapons suffers -2 to ranged attacks and no penalty to melee.
* An autonomous drone or vehicle uses 3x pilot rating to attack, dodge or pilot.
* Ramming action: A ramming action means intentionally ramming your vehicle into another. It is a simple opposed Wits+Pilot +/- Handling. Se crashes below.
* P.I.T maneuver: A P.I.T. maneuver is a simple attack action that is resolved by Wits+Pilot +/- Handling -4 vs. Wits+Pilot +/- Handling. Net successes act as a penalty to the target vehicle's next Pilot roll. Exceptional success can be used to force the defending vehicle to come to a complete stop.
Defense
* Ranged attacks against a moving vehicle suffers -2, just as when the target is running.
* An attack that targets the vehicle or passengers from the outside will be defended against by the pilot's Pilot skill + Wits +/- vehicle handling. But remember that vehicles are also large and the attacker may receive a bonus due to the target Size being higher than 5, when the vehicle is targeted and not the passengers.
* Targeting passengers suffer the cover penalty if the target is enclosed. (Someone sitting in a typical car gives -4).
* A vehicle that is not moving cannot utilize defense rolls. A drone however (as long as it is active and not surprised) is assumed to always be in slight motion and can therefore defend. This also applies to vehicles with the “Hover” tag.
Movement[du]
* A vehicle can only take one type of action to move. They use the Pilot simple action. This allows them to travel a number of moves up to their Speed rating (minimum, 1).
When using a control rig this can be done as a swift action instead, the same is true for an autonomous vehicle.
* Stopping or turning a vehicle requires a Pilot skill check. The threshold is equal to the last used speed rating to stop. Or Speed +2 to turn around and still be considered moving.[dv]
Crashes
Vehicles can be potent weapons to run down enemies or add momentum to melee attacks. They can also be death traps, by just being the means by which you travel to your impactful doom.
* Hitting a target. If you use a vehicle to run someone down you use your Piloting skill as the attack against their Dodge roll. If you hit they suffer damage equal to (net hits + vehicle size + speed[dw][dx][dy]) soaked as normal. However targets aren't always soft. The ramming vehicle takes (target size + half speed) in damage soaked by vehicles armor x2.
* Suffering a dramatic failure on a pilot roll. If the pilot suffers a dramatic failure they will crash. Generally the vehicle will suffer damage equal to its speed + size of object that gets crashed into. When hitting a much too large object (such as a large building or the ground) the size damage caps out at 15)
   * Passengers soak any damage in excess to the vehicle's armor (+1 armor for seatbelts) as normal.[dz][ea]
   * Those on a vehicle that is not enclosed do not receive the vehicle armor as bonus. They are automatically thrown off their vehicle in a crash.


Example crash: Orcus the orc is driving a muscle car as if he stole it, because that is exactly what he did. But in his haste to get away from the cops he smashes into a bus. The bus is size 11 and Orcus is going at speed 6. (17 damage) His car has armor 3 and real orcs don’t wear seatbelts. So orcus has to soak 14 damage. This is going to hurt…  
(The car will suffer 17-6= 11 structure damage out of 12.)
Chases
A chase occurs any time a party is trying to catch up to, or stay in range of, another party that is trying to get away.
Chases use structured time with initiative and rounds just like combat. At its core a chase consists of an opposed roll. The roll uses the Pilot skill for riding or vehicle chases and the Athletics skill for foot chases.
Chases follow a basic progression:


1. Determine starting distance.
* Distance is measured in “Moves” and range bands just like combat. So if the characters were in close range when the characters both begin chasing that is the starting distance. If the chased party starts running but the chaser takes other actions then the starting distance will be short.


2. The chase roll takes place at the start of every round regardless of initiative order.

3. Each pilot/chaser has to spend a simple action and roll the appropriate skill with modifiers for vehicle handling, traffic or other situational modifiers.
   * The vehicles or runners are presumed to be making progress through the environment regardless of successes.

      4. Each Net Success represents a party closing or widening the distance by 1 move. Ending up in the appropriate range band from one another.

      5. The chased party gets away when they get to extreme range and get one additional Net Success. The chase is otherwise over when the parties stop chasing. If the chaser catches up (gets inside of the engaged area) they may choose to count this as a charge action. At this point the chase is over until a party choses to disengage and start running, with the normal combat consequences of such actions.
Foot Chase
In a foot chase the chased character decides where to go. The attribute used for the athletics test is dependent on the terrain. If the chased decides to run across flat ground it is Athletics + Agility, if the chasers have to cross a trafficked street it may be Athletics + Wits to dodge the cars, if they climb a fire-escape they roll Athletics + Brawn for climbing.


Keep in mind that a chase is not only running or piloting. A running character is assumed to be using a Swift Move action and a Simple Run action. This leaves them with free actions to yell abuse and a simple action that can be used to fire a gun, pull objects into the chaser's path or cast reckless spells.
Just remember the -4 for running and -2 to any ranged attack to hit a running target.
Vehicle Chase
Vehicle chases work much like foot chases. The chased determines which direction to go, only there are generally far fewer choices. It is rarely an option to run through a store when one is piloting a vehicle. But they can head for lighter or heavier traffic or in some cases go off road. However there are two things that a chased pilot can do to change the situation:
         * Go through narrow sections. Going through an alleyway limits the size that can pass through. Generally the GM sets an appropriate threshold to go through the alley and the threshold is increased by 1 for every two sizes the vehicles are above 5. If the chased party fails then they suffer a serious complication and the followers can do a normal chase roll that is considered un-opposed. If they succeed but the chaser fails they automatically fall behind by 1 range band to go around. (A complication may see them getting stuck in the alley).
         * Stunt. Driving down stairs, leaping across an open bridge, or passing in front of an oncoming train. The chased party generally sets the threshold. If either party fail to meet the threshold they suffer a serious complication based on the stunt. GMs call.
The chasers can choose to try the stunt, risking the same as the chased. Or go around. Making them lose one range band of distance.  [eb]


Speed
Rarely a factor in foot chases. But vehicles can go at very different speeds. A driver that gets +1 success for every point of speed they travel faster than the slowest participant in the chase. However if they wish to travel at a speed that is faster than the safe speed for the type of location they are in they suffer -2 to their driving roll for every point they exceed safe speed. See table.


Example: a vehicle with speed 7 is trying to race through a suburban neighborhood. Their opponent has speed 5. Safe speed would be 4. The slower driver can at most take -2 for speed 5. If they choose to do so; the first vehicle can take up to a -6 to their roll to get 2 automatic successes if they roll at least one success.
Traveling at lower speeds means less risk of a crash, but more likely to be overtaken.


If they were on a highway with low traffic (Safe speed 8) neither would have to take any penalties to go their maximum speed and the first driver would get +2 successes at no penalty.

Lifestyle
Lifestyles quantify day to day expenses, things like food, clothes, housing, fuel or public transportation. Costs listed for these are the costs when you do not have the adequate lifestyle. Lifestyle costs are paid in the beginning of the month/end of last month and for bookkeeping reasons money spent on this is not used for weight calculation or anything and are just counted as already spent though roleplay wise you are assumed to keep it somewhere separate and use it when costs occur.


At character creation everyone starts with 1 month of Poor lifestyle. The Poor Negative quality at two ranks lowers starting lifestyle to Destitute. To start with a higher lifestyle you need to pay the difference. 


The listed inclusions are examples to make it apparent what is included. Each lifestyle naturally can also afford the lower lifestyle examples. (A well off person can afford fast food as well.)

Equipment
Equipment is divided between settings. Equipment is meant to be usable in later eras and carry over. However it may be reasonable to give older constructed weapons a penalty against modern armor.


Currency: The currency is “c” regardless of Era. This Is short for: 
“Copper (coins)” in the Medieval Era,
“Crowns” in the Industrial Era
“Credits” in the Cyber Era.


Copper coins: In the Medieval Era the main currency is copper coins. These are considered to have a value based on their material and so are traded across civilization borders. Since thousands of copper coins weigh a ridiculous amount there are coins made in more expensive metals to facilitate trade.
Silver coins: a silver coin is worth 10 copper coins.
Electrum coins: an electrum coin is worth 10 silver coins or 100 copper coins.
Gold coins: a gold coin is worth 10 Electrum coins, 100 silver coins or 1000 copper coins.


Crowns: In the industrial era most nations make their own currency, but Crowns are the unofficial trade currency and are accepted almost worldwide. Crowns exist as silver, (which has gotten cheaper to mine since the Medieval era) or as paper bills.


Credits: In the Cyber era currency is entirely digital. While many nations have their own currency the Mega Corporations and the governments that support them have rallied behind an international trade currency in the form of credits. Many traders trust Credits over their own nation's currency as they are less prone to manipulation, thus they are the primary currency almost everywhere.


Obtaining Equipment
Most items are easy to get if you have the money. Simply visit a store or merchant who sells it and you are good to go. However some items are rare, require a license or are restricted entirely outside organizations such as national or corporate armies.


Rarity: Is the term used for how difficult it is to obtain a piece of gear. It varies from 0-10 and sets the DT for checks to obtain it. 
To get illegal items characters would use Streetwise + Power to find a seller. Every 10% extra of the item's total price, they are willing to spend adds a bonus +1 to the roll up to +5.
Legal items work the same way but using whatever skill is appropriate instead.
Allies that could reasonably have access to the item in question lowers the threshold by their rating.


A major complication on a roll may mean that the character becomes the target of a sting operation.


Example: Orcus needs an assault rifle, it is illegal with Rarity: 5. Orcus has “Allies Mafia 2”. And the GM decides that they can likely help. So he needs 3 successes. Not trusting his Streetwise skill Orcus decides to pay 50% extra for +5 to his roll.


Legality: Items come in one of three categories.
Civilian (Civ): These items can be purchased by anyone with the money (though some may require them to show id and be of legal age, depending on era.)
Restricted (Res): These items can be purchased only if you have an appropriate license. This usually means a permit to carry a weapon or to operate a vehicle.
Military (Mil): Often referred to as “Mil-spec” these items are deemed too dangerous for civilians to have and are restricted to governments, megacorporations, military forces and militarized police forces. They can typically not be found at stores at all but only made and sold by special providers with high security.


Selling Equipment
Everyone falls on hard times now and again, or gets a hold of something they’d rather off-load. Whatever the reason they may feel the need to sell a piece of gear.
Legally selling gear is usually a losing proposition. Who wants your “good as new” toolkit with no insurance against shoddy quality or missing items?
So selling legal gear typically requires no roll and gives you 25% of the market price.
When selling rare or illegal gear you can add 5% of the market price per item rarity and may roll Persuasion (or Streetwise) + Power to add 5% more per Success. It is possible to receive more than 100% of the item's value.


Example: Orcus got bored with his assault rifle and decided to sell it on. It has a rarity of 5 and so will net him 50% of market value to start 25 % + (5% x 5). He rolls streetwise + Power and gets 6 successes! ((6 x 5%)+ 50% = 80%) He will receive 80% of the market value.
General Rules


Size: Every weapon and armor has a size, a measure of its length, weight and general awkwardness to wield, wear or carry. The size determines much of a weapon's stats. If a character is anything other than size 5 they can obtain weapons and armor more befitting their size. 
Armor protects the same amount, they just need to cover a larger or smaller area.
Ranged weapons remain largely unadjusted for size except for trigger guards etc.
Melee weapons increase or decrease damage to the same degree their size changes.


When purchasing weapons, armor or equipment the price is no different for smaller or larger versions. However, equipment that is found or stolen costs 10% per size to be altered.
Weapons that are not suited to a character's size suffer the inaccurate -1 tag.
Too Small armor cannot be worn, too large armor makes the wearer suffer a -2 All Action Penalty.




Encumbrance: A character can carry their Size x2 + Brawn in sizes of objects before suffering penalties. This can be increased with items such as backpacks.


Medium Encumbrance: When combined size exceeds Size x2 + Brawn the character suffers -1 to all physical actions per point in excess and can no longer take the run action.


Heavy Encumbrance: When combined size exceeds Encumbrance by 50%: (Size x2 + Brawn) x 1.5,  the character's move action now takes a simple action to perform. When combined size reaches Encumbrance x2  they can no longer move until they shed some weight.


Size 0: You can carry 3 size 0 objects before they give 1 size worth of encumbrance. Very small objects such as coins or similar have special rules.


Clothing: Regular (non-armored) clothing have no encumbrance when worn)


Quality
Gear comes in separate qualities. This is generally representative of the degree of success on the gears crafting roll. A poor quality weapon represents a complication in crafting or a cost saving measure in production.


Poor Quality: A “poor” piece of equipment counts as “damaged” in all respects, including reduced structure, except that it cannot be repaired.
Poor quality equipment costs only 50% of normal equipment. If the gear is not a type that can suffer the penalties associated with “damaged” then it cannot be purchased at a discount.
Rarity decreased by 1.


Average Quality: This is the typical quality of gear.


High Quality (Impressive): A “High Quality” piece of gear receives +1 to applicable dice pools. High quality armors: Medium Armor counts as Light armor, Heavy armor counts as Medium. Light armor has -1 encumbrance (min 1)
An item of High Quality cost 2x base price. (Minimum 2000) Rarity increased by 2.


Exceptional Quality: An “Exceptional Quality” piece of gear receives +1 to Static bonuses such as Armor or Damage. Applicable dice pools receive a +1. If there is no static bonus such as Armor or Damage then the dice pool bonus is increased to +2. Additionally the gear’s Armor is increased by 1. (Increasing structure by 1 and soak by 2)
An item of Exceptional Quality cost 5x base price. (Minimum 5000) Rarity increased by 3.
Weapon Rules
Brawn requirement: To wield a weapon effectively in two hands you must have a brawn rating equal to its size. To wield it in one hand you must have a rating equal to twice the size rating. Each point below the requirement imposes a -2 to any use of the weapon, attack, parry and initiative. There are object qualities such as “1 or 2-handed” that lowers the requirements.
Wielding a two-handed firearm (size 4+) in one hand cannot completely undo the penalty and so a -2 always remains and cannot be compensated.[ec][ed]
Items that are not typically weapon sized for use, such as trying to hit someone with another person or a motorcycle requires the wielder to have Brawn equal to 2x the size of the item to wield properly..


Damage: Damage is either a static number indicating the damage a weapon does before adding net successes, or it is noted with a “+” before the number. “+” indicates that the weapons damage does Brawn +Damage. Certain weapons such as bows may add Brawn/2 instead if listed. 


Damage type is also indicated with an “L” for Lethal or “S” for stun. Depending on if your weapon will cause the enemy serious harm or bruise them/knock them unconscious.




Initiative: The initiative roll is decreased by the size of the weapon or object you intend to use.
If you use two weapons or a weapon and a shield: count the higher of the sizes + size/2 for the smaller.
Medium and heavy armor can also lower a character's initiative.


Grenades (thrown explosives): Grenades can either be set to explode on a timer or on impact. Regardless of how they detonate, throwing or firing a grenade in a specific spot has a threshold of 3. Failing to meet this threshold makes the grenade go awry[ee][ef]. 
If the threshold is met and the grenade goes off, the targets inside the explosive area have to roll a defense test (with -4 for explosives with area: engaged, or -8 for area: close) opposing the attack to launch the grenade. Any net successes on grenade tests do not add to damage.
A timed grenade functions much the same way but does not explode until the same initiative on the following round, and since the throw is long since passed the attack simply counts as 3.
An impact grenade fired directly at a target adds net net successes to the damage like any other attack. But not to those affected in the blast area.


Standard Mods: These are weapon modifications that come standard as part of the weapon. Some can be removed, such as a sniper rifle's scope. These still take the usual modification slots and prevent any non-compatible modifications as normal.




OPTIONAL RULE: Oversized weapons: Using a weapon with a size greater than the character increases the brawn requirement by 1 per size difference (Brawn Requirement for a human (size 5) to wield a pike (size 6) is 7 to wield in two hands and 14 to wield in 1.
OPTIONAL RULE: Undersized weapons: Using a weapon with size smaller than character size –5 (size 0 for trolls (size 6)) imposes -2 to any use of the weapon, attack, parry or initiative.
Melee Weapon Rules
Parry: Parrying is affected by the difference in reach between combatants. If the defender has higher reach the attacker suffers the difference to their attack roll. If the attacker has greater reach the defender suffers the difference (this is always expressed as a penalty, never a bonus). 
A weapon's reach does not matter for defense if the weapon cannot parry (such as a whip or lasso). 
For calculating reach see below.


Melee weapons typically do damage equal to size, however there are exceptions such as spears that are long but have short blades or clubs that lack the impact of crafted weapons of similar size.


Reach: Reach determines the bonus or penalty to Attack and Parry when using a weapon in melee combat. 
Reach is a weapons size + (character size-5) + object quality affecting size.

Armor[gf]
Armor Rules
Armor Rating: Armor rating adds to a character's Soak value and Lethal Threshold. 
Incoming Damage is decreased by a character's Brawn/2 and Effective Armor Rating.


Lethal Threshold: If a Lethal Weapon’s Base Damage + Armor Piercing Value is higher than the target's Armor Rating x2 then the Damage is Lethal otherwise it is changed to Stun Damage.


Size: Armor Size is listed as intended for Size 5 characters. Larger or smaller characters armors size should be altered accordingly, without altering armor coverage.


Coverage: An armors Size determines what areas of the body are protected from damage. Standard and Area Attacks always target the torso. To target something other than the torso, a called shot is required.
Size 5: Full body, except head.
Size 4: Torso and Arms.
Size 3: Torso only.[gg]


Armor Layers: Up to 2 armor layers can be combined as long as at least one layer is Soft. The character receives the full bonus of the best layer and half bonus of the second layer. This comes with a penalty of -1 to all physical actions, Initiative and Defense per extra armor in addition to any penalties from Medium or Heavy armor.
Natural or implanted armor does not count as a layer for the purposes of penalties or maximum number of layers but still only apply half their armor rating (rounded up) if combined with better armor


Helmets/Location specific armor: These only protect against called shots against the specific location. When counting penalties for armor type (heavy, medium, light) Only apply the highest and ignore the rest.
Location specific armor applies only half Size to encumbrance, (add all together before halving).
 
Ballistic rating: (stand in rule) Ballistic rating is only used against firearms (weapons with the “ballistic” tag. People are meant to be able to use armor in any era but the reason not to bother with a medieval full plate in an industrial or modern setting is that bullets go through it with relative ease.

	Tags
1 or 2-handed: This weapon is easier to use one-handed. The 1-handed Brawn requirement is Brawn + Brawn/2 rounded down, instead of Brawn x2.


Area: this affects all in an area around the main target. 
         * Area: Engaged affects all in engaged range with the target and they take -3 to defend against the effect.
         * Area: Close affects all within close range of the target and they take -6 to defend against the effect.


Armor Piercing: the Armor Piercing value ignores an amount of the opponent's armor against the attack. It has no effect on Brawn-based Soak.


Armor Wrecker: achieving a Critical success using a weapon with this quality damages the target's armor. It lowers the armor value equal to the Armor Wrecker value, the armor will remain damaged until repaired.


Ballistic: The weapon damage is soaked using the ballistic armor value rather than the regular one.


Bash: The shield can be used as a melee weapon without counting as improvised. It has a damage equal to the listed value, stun damage unless the shield is spiked.
Blunt: The weapon can do Lethal or Stun damage with no added penalty. This is listed on the weapons table.


Brawling: The weapon uses the Unarmed skill to attack, if the weapon can parry; the wielder will use the Unarmed skill to do so.


Chameleon Skin: The armor changes color to reflect the surroundings. This gives a -4 to spot the wearer unless the spotter has thermal vision.


Concealed: The weapon or item is very easy to conceal or is naturally concealed. This gives a -4 penalty to spot the weapon when not in use.


Disarming: The weapon is designed in such a way that it makes disarming easier. If the wielder scores a Critical success they can disarm their opponent in addition to normal damage. Or if doing a disarming called shot (page reference)[gi] it decreases the penalty by 2.


Enclosed: The helmet obscures senses and makes it harder to react to threats. Wearing this gives -1 to Wits.


Flaming: The weapon does fire damage and can light enemies on fire. If an attack with this weapon scores a Critical success it sets the target on fire. Giving the “On fire” condition(page reference)[gj]. Additionally while in use the weapon gives off light.


Fragile: Minor Complications on attack or parry may inflict Damaged Condition[gk] to gear, Major Complications may destroy the equipment.


Gaping Wounds: The weapon has a propensity for causing bleeding wounds. If an attack with this weapon scores a Critical success it can cause the “Gaping Wounds” condition (page reference)[gl] on its target. Requires the attack to cause at least 1 Lethal Damage.


Gruesome: When this weapon scores a good hit the wounds it causes can be absolutely gruesome. Attack rolls with this weapon get “exploding 6s”(page reference)[gm].


Grapple: The use of this weapon required the establishing of a grapple. In the case of garottes, monofilament and regular, the grapple has to be established with a targeted attack against the neck/throat. In return it imposes the “Choking[gn][go]” condition (page reference)[gp].


Headcracker: Attacks targeting the head with this weapon receive a +2 damage rating.


Heavy: Armors with this quality slow you down. You suffer a -2 penalty to all physical actions, Initiative and Defense. When wearing heavy armor on the hands and feet you also have the equivalent of brass knuckles (+1S) when performing Unarmed Attacks. When calculating armor penalty, count only the heaviest piece. Armor penalty is not additive.


Implant: Implanted weapons cannot be disarmed and receive a +1 to attack and parry due to the interconnectivity with your nervous system.


Inaccurate: Weapons with this quality are bad at hitting what they aim for. Attack rolls with these weapons suffer the listed penalty to attack rolls.


Increased reach: Some weapons can reach further than their size suggests. They add the listed value to their reach. Weapons that cannot parry only add the value to their reach on attack rolls.


Injector: Weapons with this quality don’t do damage. They are used to inject a chemical (usually poison) into their targets. In order to successfully inject their target they need to hit a target where they possess no armor. 
Alternatively they can successfully inject with a Critical success on the attack roll regardless of the target's armor.


Light: This signifies that an object is lighter than its size suggests. The Encumbrance of the object is Size/2.


Longshot: By arching a shot this weapon can sacrifice damage instead of aim when firing at a longer range. When shooting at an object at one range band further than optimal range. The wielder can do 1 less damage instead of taking -2 to hit.


Medium: Armors with this quality slow you down somewhat. You suffer a -1 penalty to all physical actions, Initiative and Defense. When calculating armor penalty, count only the heaviest piece. Armor penalty is not additive.


Open: A helmet with this quality does not impede its wearer's vision but it leaves the face unprotected.


Parrying: This weapon has a good guard or other quality that makes it better to use for parrying. The wielder receives the listed bonus when parrying close combat attacks with this weapon.


Powered: The armor needs to connect to the user's nervous system, such as through a Jack. When doing so the wearer receives a +2 bonus to Brawn (augmented maximum and tolerance apply as normal). Wearing the armor without connection increases its encumbrance by half.


Quick: The weapon is quick to draw and wield. The wielders receive an initiative bonus equal to the Quick rating when using the weapon.


Restraining: The weapon can be used to restrain someone in grapple. (page reference)[gq]
Risky: It is easy to make mistakes with this weapon. A risky weapon requires one less “1” rolled for complications. Additionally the GM is encouraged to have complications result in the user injuring themselves.


Shocking: The weapon is electrified. It does 1 more damage against targets in metal armor. In addition, on a Critical success the weapon can inflict the “Shocked[gr]” condition (page reference)[gs]. On an exceptional success the weapon can inflict the “Stunned” condition.


Slow Reload: The weapon takes a lot of time and effort to reload. Reloading takes a number of Complex actions, as listed. At the GMs discretion multiple characters can help reload by each taking one complex action.


Throwing: The weapon can be thrown without making it an improvised weapon. It has an optimal range of close and a maximum range of medium.


Tripping: The weapon can make a person trip and fall prone. If the wielder scores a Critical success they can trip their opponent in addition to normal damage. Or if doing a trip called shot (page reference)[gt] it decreases the penalty by 2. A tripped character suffers the “Prone” condition.(page reference)[gu]


Trapping: The weapon inflicts the “Off balance” condition on a successful hit (page reference)[gv]. On a Critical success the weapon can inflict the “Trapped[gw] condition” (page reference)[gx].




Visor: A helmet with a visor allows the wearer to lower it. Making the helmet enclosed (-1 Wits) but shields face, or have it raised and suffer no penalty but leave the face exposed to attack.
Weapon Modifications[gy]
General
Number of mods: Most weapons can have a combined total size of mods equal to 2x size, Size 0 weapons have a total modification capacity of 1. 
Some weapons specifically have more or less, listed in their description. Mods that come standard with a weapon still count towards the size and location limit


Mods with a size listed as “+” such as +1 means it effectively also increases the weapons size by that amount. Mods that increase size do not increase the maximum number of mods.


Mod Placement: You can only have one mod per slot.
         * All firearms have Grip/Stock, Top, Whole, Muzzle and Side-slot. Only firearms 3+ have an under barrel slot.
         * Magazines are items in and of themselves. They do not count against the size limit but you can still only have one magazine mod.
         * Melee weapons have Grip/Stock, Whole and Blade-slots. (Blade does not mean the weapon has a blade, it is merely a reference to the weapons strike zone.) 




Cost: Most modifications have a cost as specified. A few mods have a cost based on the weapon cost, such as “Double weapon cost”. These only account for the base cost of a weapon. If you have a higher quality weapon this does NOT double the cost of the modification.
Ranged weapon mods
Autofire and mods: If using Autofire mods that lowers the Brawn Requirement; they are applied after the doubling.

         * Bayonet (Underbarrel)
         * A bayonet turns the ballistic weapon (Size 4+) into a short spear (see Melee, weapons table for stats.)
         * Bipod  (Underbarrel) (req. size 4+)
         * A Bipod lowers the strength requirement by 2 when extended. It can be extended as a simple action and needs the weapon to be supported. On cover or with the user prone.
         * Carbon fiber parts (Whole)
         * This lowers the weapons encumbrance by 2 (minimum 1).
         * Compound (Whole) Bows only
         * Armor piercing 2.
         * Drum magazine (Magazine)
         * A drum magazine changes the ammo capacity to 3x normal (for mags) but increases the weapons size by 2.
         * Expanded magazine (Magazine)
         * An expanded magazine changes the ammo capacity to 1.5x normal (for mags) but increases the weapon size by 1.
         * Extendable stock (Stock/Grip)
         * A stock that can be folded out. Helps with extra support or making large weapons more concealable. The stock can be extended as a simple action. On weapons without a stock (size 2 and lower) extending the stock lowers the strength requirement by 2. But having a stock on the weapon increases size (including strength requirement by 1.)
On weapons with an existing stock this lowers weapon size by 1 when retracted but increases strength requirement by 2.
         * Flashlight (Side)
         * Lowers darkness penalties by 4 in short range or closer. Cannot be combined with Laser Sight.
         * Foregrip  (Underbarrel)
         * Only on weapons size 3+. Lowers strength requirement for 2-handed use by 1.
         * Gas vent (Muzzle)
         * Cannot be combined with Suppressor. Full Automatic increases Strength requirement by half instead of doubling it. 
         * Laser Sight (Side)
         * Weapon receives an additional optimal range at one range closer than weapons normal optimal range. Cannot be combined with Flashlight[ha]. (If combined with scope then the optimal ranges are the new one provided by the scope as well as one closer.)
         * Personalized grip (Stock/Grip)
         * Attacks receive an additional +1 dice pool when aiming. Applies only to the intended user. All others suffer -1.
         * Rail System
         * Allows quickly changing out Underbarrel and top slots with only 2 complex actions instead of spending minutes modifying the gun. All the modifications still need to be purchased and carried of course.
         * Rangefinder (Top/Side)
         * Shooting beyond optimal range suffers only -1 per Range band.
         * Scope (Top) 
         * Optimal Range is shifted one range further away.
         * Smart Gun system (Whole)
         * Attacks with this weapon receive a +1 if the user has a Datajack. +2 if user has a smartlink in their eyes. Additionally allows shooting around cover with half blind-fire penalty.
         * Allows the use of “Smart Bullets”
         * Sound/flash Suppressor (Muzzle)
         * Suppressors increase the base threshold to hear the shots from 1 to 3.
         * Underbarrel launcher/shotgun (Underbarrel) (req. size 3+)
         * See ranged weapons table for details.
         * User-identification system: (Stock/Grip) (requires smart gun system)
         * The gun only fires when it recognizes an authorized user. Anyone trying to fire your weapon will expend their attack action with no effect.

Body modifications
General rules
Tolerance loss: The Tolerance you lose when installing body modifications is the same regardless of what the bonus it provides is. This is the potential upside of sacrificing Credits and Tolerance long term without the ability to change it without major surgery.


Armor: Armor provided by Body Modifications adds its rating to both Normal and Ballistic armor.
         * Skin and Bone modifications add armor to all body parts except eyes.




Cyberlimbs/Cyber Replacements
Cyber replacements; Arms, Legs, Skull, Torso, Eyes/ears, all require the original to be removed from the body, this means that the original needs to be restored by Regeneration or Cloning to recover the spent Tolerance.
These replacements are far more durable than the flesh, blood and bone they replace. Replacements count as having natural armor 4 (5 if Exceptional Quality) and do not count as vulnerable. 
(Torso replacements are technically “center mass” but they still only count these bonuses against called shots.)


Capacity: Cyberlimbs typically have “Capacity” this means that they are meant to be altered by adding additional modifications. The size of cyberware modifications represent the amount of capacity they take. 
Example: A cyber arm (capacity 5), could take one size 3 augmentation and two size 1s for example.
Quality
Used: Augmentations that have been ripped out of a previous owner automatically loses one level of quality. Rarity decreased by 1.
        
Poor: Inferior Augmentations come cheap but the cost still comes due. Poor Quality augmentations cost only 50% of the standard price. However their Tolerance cost is increased by 0.5.


Standard: Has the stats and price as listed.


Impressive: Impressive augmentations have a slightly lesser impact on the body. Lower the Tolerance cost by 0.5. 
Augmentations with 0.5 Tolerance cost, or less, do not receive any benefit from this. [hf]
Augmentation of High Quality cost 2x base price. (Minimum 2000) Rarity increased by 2.


Exceptional Quality: Exceptional Augmentations receive the bonus of the Impressive Quality. In addition the bonus granted by the augmentation is increased by 1. 
In the case of Cyberlimbs etc. The capacity is increased by 1. Augmentations that do not grant a bonus receive no benefit from this.
Replacement limbs or organs receive +1 natural armor to called shots against it.
An Augmentation of Exceptional Quality cost 5x base price. (Minimum 5000). Rarity increased by 3.

General
Natural looking
         * This makes the cyberware look realistic. It is coated with a bio-material that makes it difficult to detect (Threshold 4). Additionally the coating prevents extra electrical and cold damage from exposed metal.


Implanted Gear
         * Who doesn’t want a welding torch in their finger? Or a holoprojector in their butt? Well thanks to implanted gear you can! So get off your holoprojector and get to installing!
You can install a piece of personal equipment in a limb. Unlike the hidden compartment you cannot simply replace the gear. Which means it’s also hard to take it from you. (For Weapons see. Weapon Implant)
        Skulls can only hold size 1 and 0.


Weapon Implant
         * Want to perform a literal axe kick? Shoot a submachine gun out of your arm? Then you need a weapon implant!
You can implant a weapon in your body that can be extended for use with a Swift Action.
Eyes and skull can only hold size 0 weapons. Ears cannot hold any.


Eye/ear mods
These mods can be installed in Cybereyes/Cyberears as well as contacts, Glasses or Goggles. A character cannot benefit from multiple vision devices at once.


Augmented Reality (AR)
         * This allows the wearer to perceive augmented reality such as Matrix Objects, navigation assistance, incoming calls and texts. This is vital to stay connected and informed in the Cyber Era.


Enhanced Senses
         * Sharper sight, clearer hearing, digital outlining of objects and isolation of sounds. 
Provides a +1 or +2 to perception rolls in return for taking up 1 or 2 capacity.


Eye Lights
         * A pair of red eyes light up in the darkness… In this case they can belong to you. A pair of flashlights that always point where you are looking. Can be turned on or off with a free action and the color can be adjusted as the wearer wishes.
Decreases darkness penalties by 4. But adds a -3 penalty to stealth when active.


Glare/Decibel Protection
         * Auto-darkening lenses and ear protection that blocks any part of a sound that goes above a certain decibel. Great to save oneself from deafening sounds and bright lights. Or to make concerts and raves appear much more dull.
Makes the character immune to deafening and blinding due to noise/light.


Nightvision
         * See like a dwarf! This enhances any ambient light to allow much better vision, unfortunately it is still hard to distinguish color or writing.
Halves all penalties for darkness except for complete darkness or blindness. This does not stack with other sources of night vision.


Radar/Sonar
         * Your ears can emit a ping that reflects off surfaces and returns to you based on distance to objects. This is used by the software in the eyes to project a model of your surroundings, including a warning for things behind you.
You suffer no penalty to detect objects or people due to darkness or invisibility. However it does not allow you to detect details.
 
Recorder
         * You can record up to 4 hours of Video and Audio through your eyes and ears. Going over the footage later may let you detect things you did not notice the first time around.
Going over recordings can let you roll a new Investigation or Perception check to notice new details.


Retina Duplication (Cybereyes only)
         * Ever wish you could have a pair of beautiful eyes? Well now you can! You can duplicate others' retinas by studying them. This can be used to open whole new (retina locked) doors in your life! It is naturally highly illegal.
You need to maintain a full 30 seconds of eye contact to accurately copy another's retina. Neither party is allowed to blink. The eyes maintain the duplicate until changed and only keeps a base retina saved so the user can have one of their own (or none).




Smartgun Link (requires datajack)
         * Why can’t guns tell you where to aim? Well Smart guns can! As long as you have a Smartgun Link to your eyes and a Datajack.
You receive the +2 smartgun bonus listed in weapon modifications when using a smart weapon.


Thermal Vision (Infrared)
         * Thermal (Infrared) vision allows you to detect things by the heat radiation they give off instead of the light they reflect.
You suffer no penalties to detect people, creatures and vehicles, even in complete darkness. As long as they give off heat. Does not help with invisibility.


Zooming Eyes/Laser microphone
         * Tired of carrying around binoculars? Well now you don’t have to! Your eyes have up to x10 digital zoom. When paired with ears this allows you to also listen in at a distance as long as you are also zoomed.
You can ignore up to -4 in distance penalties for perception checks when looking at something specific.
If paired with the SmartGun Link this can also be used in lieu of a scope. (increasing optimal range by one step).
Arm/Leg Mod/Torso mods
Arm Extensions (Arm Only)
         * Tired of not reaching the top shelf? Well just get Arm Extensions!
Gives the character +1 reach with the arm. Extensions in both arms are required for bonus to two-handed weapons and also gives +1 to grapple checks.


Ball Joints
         * Ever feel like scratching your shoulder with the arm it’s attached to? Then Ball Joints are for you! They make you hypermobile.
Ball joints grant an increased agility to use of the limb. Attacks and thievery using the arm, stealth and athletics using the legs. Torso modification improves initiative.


Carbon Fiber Muscle
         * Why settle for flesh and blood muscles when you can have carbon fiber and hydraulic fluid?
Carbon Fibre Muscle grants an increased Brawn for lifting and combat actions using the limb. Torso modification improves health and soak.


Handprint Copier (Arm only)
         * Fingerprints are unique! A common myth. But nothing makes it as mythical as a handprint copier. Great for opening people's comlinks or using locked weapons. Naturally this is highly illegal.
The hand can copy whole or partial prints from a hand or undamaged prints left behind. The hand maintains the print until changed and only keeps a base print saved so the user can have a print of their own (or none).


Hidden Compartment
         * Tired of lugging your bag around? Why not put it inside you? That wasn’t an insult or innuendo, but a genuine suggestion possible thanks to the Hidden compartment. A further bonus is how hard it is to find it for anyone who doesn’t know where to look.
Pulling an item from a closed compartment is a complex action. Finding a hidden compartment is a DT: 5 perception check.


Hydraulic Legs (Legs only)
         * Wanna leap tall buildings? Well that may be a bit out of your league but Hydraulic Legs help you jump exceptionally far or high.
Hydraulic legs give you a +4 bonus to Athletics checks to jump, land without injury, and kick objects. 
(The Hydraulics aren’t fast enough to use in attack actions.)




Lung Replacement (Torso only)
         * You know what doesn’t make sense? Having a pair of fleshy balloons in your chest. Instead an internal air-tank with a pump system can handle the whole “breathing” thing just fine, if you’re into that sort of thing…
Lung replacement makes the character immune to choking from outside and they can “hold their breath” for up to an hour with no ill effects. Additionally the throat is no longer considered a vulnerable body part.
 
Shock Hand (Arm only)
         * It’s just like a joke hand-buzzer, except the victim may be falling to the floor in spasms. What a hoot!
Functions like a shock glove, only without the glove part.


Water Jets (Legs only)
         * Have you ever wanted a jetski? Have you ever wanted to BE a jetski? Well now you can! A propulsion system in your legs allow you to take in water and propel it out of the soles of your feet. Letting you shoot forward in the water like a torpedo.
Water jets let you Swim with a +4 bonus to your athletics checks, additionally you can move in water as a simple action (and take a swimming “run” action as another.)




Skull mods
Computer Implant
         * Ever wish you could add some computing power to your brain? This is it! Fusing your neuron pathways to a computer may sound unpleasant but it will make your intellect soar.
Increases logic, furthermore: When combined with a datajack you can use it to instantly, albeit temporarily, learn information store on data-, or skill chips. You can keep a number of chips slotted equal to the rating of your Computer implant.


Cyberdeck Implant
         * Hacking is great, but with an implant it only requires thought. The matrix is your oyster and the pearl is lodged in direct contact with your brain.
Functions as a regular Cyberdeck that is always direct connected to you.


Face Sculpt
         * Thanks to countless hinges, micromotors, and extendable bones you can get those cheekbones you’ve always dreamed of! And when you get sick of them you can change them in some other way.
The character can change their facial features (but has no effect on hair or the rest of the body) Giving them +2 to subterfuge when impersonating someone.


Frightening Appearance
         * Not all Cyberware looks nice and sleek. They can also have spikes coming out of skin, skull features, or other intimidating features. Gives +2 to intimidation checks in person, but +4 to any roll to remember or recognize the character.

	Chemicals
Poisons, Medicine and drugs. These come in many forms. But they all essentially work the same. Medicine and drugs are just poisons with more beneficial effects than negative.
Rules
Resistance: Unless otherwise specified, Chemicals are resisted with a physical resistance roll.
A character may not wish to resist a Chemical, such as with beneficial drugs, they can then opt to count their resistance roll as 0 successes regardless of their actual result. But must still roll to see if they suffer a Complication. Even beneficial chemicals can suffer Side effects as complications.


Attacks with chemicals: Chemicals may often be used as part of an attack, from poison on an assassin's dagger to pepper spray used by an overzealous security officer.
When this occurs an attack often needs a Critical success in order for the Chemical to be successfully applied. Resolve the attack first, before dealing with the chemical effects separately. Successes on attack do not affect the strength of the chemical. 
Certain delivery systems, such as a spray, that have no effect beyond delivering the chemical, may inflict penalties to the resistance roll or apply additional effects with targeted attacks or Critical successes.


Type: This indicates what type of chemical it is.


Drugs are typically more beneficial than Poison. 


Poison is typically harmful with little to no positive effects.


Vector: This is an indicator of how the chemical is to be applied to the target.
Contact: This means that the target has to be in skin contact for the chemical to be effective. It has to hit an unarmored body part or achieve a Critical effect on an attack with a coated weapon.
Inhaled: This means that the chemical is in a gaseous form that the target(s) have to inhale for it to be effective.
Ingestion: This means that the target has to swallow the chemical for it to be effective.
Injection: This means that the chemical has to be injected into the bloodstream, this can be done either through an injector or by achieving an impressive success and dealing lethal damage with a weapon coated in the chemical.


Strength: This indicates the number of successes needed to resist the chemical. It decreases by one at every speed interval after the first. Impressive success on this roll gives the target +2 on the next resistance roll. Exceptional success means that the target is no longer affected by the chemical.
If the Strength falls to 3 or less the target only needs a basic success to no longer be affected.


Doses: If a target is affected by multiple doses each dose increases the chemical Strength by 2, up to a maximum of the original strengths augmented maximum. (1.5x or +5, whichever is lower).
Taking multiple doses or multiple drugs at the same time raises the risks. The complications on the resistance roll for beneficial drugs are increased by one severity. Minor to major, Major to Dramatic.


Effect: These are the effects caused by the chemical.
Base: These are effects that apply as long as the target fails to resist any of the Strength.
Advanced (Adv.): These are effects that apply as long as the target fails to resist half the strength.
Varied (V): These are effects that are dependent on Strength after resisting.


Side Effects: These are suggested complications. The GM is free to choose other ones. If more than one Side effect is listed then the first one is meant for minor complications and the second for major ones. Dramatic failures are not listed, however It is suggested to make a more severe effect of the existing side effects. For example an overdose may cause 2x strength lethal damage instead of just 1x.


Addictive: (Minor) The character has to make a mental resistance roll DT: V, failure means suffering the “Addicted” condition to the chemical in question.
All Action Penalty: (Minor) All action penalty for the remainder of the drug's duration.
Attribute: (Brawn, Agility, Logic, Wits, Power, Cool): These give a varied effect bonus to the listed attribute up to Augmented Maximum.
Damage (Lethal/Stun): These cause damage equal to the varied effect of the indicated type, this damage is not soaked.
Darkvision: The target halves penalties for darkness except in absolute darkness.
Frenzy: (Minor) This causes the target to be under the effect of the Frenzy condition for the remainder of the drug's duration.
Ignore wounds: The target ignores wounds equal to V for the purposes of penalties. Until the chemical wears off.
Light Sensitive: (Minor) This causes the character to suffer the partially blinded conditions if exposed to bright light.
Nausea: The target suffers the Nauseated condition. Until the chemical wears off.
Overdose: (Major) The character suffers remaining Strength as Lethal Damage.
Paralysis: The target suffers the Paralysed condition until the chemical wears off.
Paranoia: (Minor) Suffers the Paranoid condition for the remainder of the drug's duration.
Perception bonus: The target gets a perception bonus equal to the varied effect. (Count as augmented maximum based on Wits, i.e. +half wits or +5)
Sick: The target suffers the Sick condition. Remains even after the chemical wears off.
Stunned: The target suffers the Stunned condition. Until the chemical wears off.
Slow fall: Character falls slowly like a feather. They suffer no falling damage.
Squeaky Voice: (Minor) Character speaks with a voice as if they had inhaled Helium (-3 intimidation) For hours = Strength.


Speed: This indicates how often the chemical affects the target.
If the speed is 1 minute it means that the chemical takes effect 1 minute after being applied and that the character has to roll to resist strength (-1 strength at each iteration after the first) at every interval of 1 minute until they achieve Exceptional success.

Tolerance: Beneficial effects cost Tolerance. If these are listed as V or V/2 it means that the tolerance cost is equal to the Varied effect (the remaining effect after the resistance roll).

Amnesium: A favorite of those who do terrible things and don’t want to remember (or don’t want their victims to). Herbs, said to hail from the Astral Realm of the Fey, capable of erasing people's short term memories. However since none will remember taking it, a common side effect is paranoia.


Anestesia: Not a single drug but rather a collection too large to list. Anestesia is meant to keep patients sedated during surgery. If someone monitors the doses with a Medicine + Logic DT: 3 check, they can ensure that the Anestesia does not overflow to lethal damage.


Arrest: The adopted street name of a paralytic made from concentrating Silk-Spider Venom. It is a particular favorite of Bounty hunters and those who wish to take down a target non-lethally. However the medical community suggest that the name should be “cardiac arrest” for the occasional overdose.


Arsenic: A naturally occurring heavy metal that is toxic to humanoids. It causes nausea and vomiting. Worst of all Arsenic is a slow killer, those without medical assistance may find death a relief after hours of suffering.


Balloon Shroom: A useful yet humorous fungus that has been touched by the Astral Realm of Air. As the fungus grows it swells and becomes naturally buoyant along with its roots and typically nestles under the branches of trees where it makes a new home. If harvested before its buoyant state it can cause a similar effect in humanoids. They swell up, enough to fall harmlessly from great heights and enable great leaps as if in low gravity. In many it also causes a helium like effect on the users voice.
It sees use mostly by entertainers and at the children's parties of the wealthy but is also made use of by adventurous individuals who lack access to air magic.


Black Lotus: A beautiful flower said to reflect the perfect void of the Astral Realm of Darkness. The black lotus is considered a death sentence by many and is a favorite “additive” to victims' food by assassins. It is near flavorless and provides ample time for the killer to escape before symptoms appear.


Blackwood Sap: Sap from the famous blackwood trees. The pitch like sap is a bit smelly and stings when applied just under the eyes but within a few minutes the eyes start absorbing a great deal of light. Many say that the eyes become dark like the trees themselves but in reality it is simply a matter of a much expanded pupil. This makes it easier to see, especially in the dark, but beware bright lights!


Bulkup: Need a beach-bod? Or to lift a car? What you really need is (to) BULKUP! Bulkup is steroids on steroids. Instead of letting you build muscles faster, Bulkup instantly pumps you full of adrenaline, hormones and various compounds that will make your “guns totally ripped” within minutes. However like steroids, uncontrollable rage is a common side effect.


C-NOZ: “Compound Nitrous Oxide Zopiclone” is a mouthful. But “C-NOZ” (pronounced Snooze) is the preferred term even in professional settings. Starting as an anesthetic compound, C-NOZ  was adapted by law enforcement and military worldwide as a less lethal chemical weapon. Capable of clearing buildings with minimal civilian casualties.


Cocaine: “Snow”, “Nose candy” it is known by many names but can really give even the most anti-social character the chops needed for a party. The other upside is that this upper really kicks adrenaline in high gear. For when you want things done “NOW”.


Cragg: Wanna get “Rock hard”? Then Cragg is for you! It is not a little blue pill, it is an injection of a magical mineral that modern science has found a way to bind to the outer skin levels. It is a highly unpleasant experience but it gives your skin mineral plating. Highly visible but really helps against suffering fatal wounds. A lot of characters struggle with the pain and new earth-elemental-like body parts. But better made of ground than buried in it.


Fly Agaric (treated): Eating red-capped mushrooms with little white dots is a great way to risk painful death. But treat it right and your body will only think you are dying, releasing massive adrenaline, making you temporarily ignore your pain, and possibly giving you hysterical strength. However the mushrooms are still not good for you and you may find yourself filling up with rage.


Hemlock: Most famous for its ability to kill famous philosophers, hemlock is a moderately fast poison. It's mostly preferred for its relatively low price and easy availability. It strikes the middle ground, not unbearably slow or particularly fast. It’s more commonly found amongst low price assassins than more capable ones.


Marjuana: “Relax bro! Just take a few puffs and calm down.” Mostly used as a recreational drug or in religious services it is also useful to help with unpleasant treatments. Typically cheap and readily available is what makes this popular.


Mescaline: Mescaline is the active compound of many hallucinogens. Often thought of as a way to more easily connect with the gods (Dolus in particular) it is also a way to force a character to introspection or to find one's place in the universe. For those who do not throw up or suddenly realize that everyone is out to get them, it can be a life changing experience.


Morphine: Morphine is an opioid used to treat those in tremendous amounts of pain. Or those who want such a relaxing time that waking up is a secondary concern. Morphine is extremely tiring for most, but it's often worth it if you are suddenly missing a limb.


Opium: From where the term “opioid” stems. In its naturally occurring form opium isn’t nearly as powerful as the later drugs that will be derived from it. But it is still a useful way to overcome pain. Many use it to dull physical pain or that of mere existence and find that it is not a crutch they are willing to give up. During the late Medieval Era and to a much greater extent in the Industrial Era, opium dens are commonplace in many parts of the world.


Rally: Named for its “rallying effect”, Rally has managed what generals have tried to do for millenia; expel the  fear from their soldiers and turn their focus razor sharp. Fast acting but very temporary, it knocks the fear out just long enough to turn a disorganized rout into a counterattack. 


Rápid: A combat drug that boosts the users reaction time like none other. Those who see it in action often attribute their users to being “super soldiers” Bursts of speed that facilitate both attack and defense. Sudden changes in positions or charges that go further than they should. A dose of Rápid can turn the tide of battle.


Selvan Fly: “Can you smell it? Selvan Fly, the world's most powerful aphrodisiac. Makes you irresistible.”
The skin absorbs Selvan Fly and it changes your sweat glands to exude a fragrant pheromone. While the ads call it an Aphrodisiac there is no evidence of that. Rather Selvan Fly may fool those around you to find you more desirable.
Selvan Fly is a must have for those who are looking to find love at the local dance club.


Silk-Spider Venom: While most spiders produce a form of silk, the Silk-Spider, which varies in size from an average dog to a bear, produces enough to embalm humanoids. But in order to do this it must first paralyze them. The Silk-Spiders produce a potent paralytic toxin from their mandibles meant to slow down their victims or hold them in place until they can be wrapped up for later digestion.


Venom (Mild): A variety of animals, including, scorpions, spiders and vipers, exude a venom to take down prey or serve as self defense. These venoms are rarely potent enough to be deadly to humanoids but can cause long term illness.


Venom (Potent): Venomous animals that have to deal with larger predators or prey on a daily basis usually possess a venom that can be deadly even to humanoids. It burns through the body fast driving the immune system into overdrive trying to expel the venom while the actual toxin may damage vital organs. “Bug spray sounds pretty good now eh?”








Explosives (Planted)
While explosives in combat encounters are mostly useful in an easily throwable or launchable state such as grenades, rockets or explosive rounds, there are times when characters may seek to demolish; obstacles, buildings, or trolls. In these situations there’s the option of using planted explosives. These are typically placed on or adjacent to the intended target or set up as a trap or mine for unsuspecting trespassers.
Rules
Planting: Planting an explosive can be as simple as simply dropping it somewhere, however this is not very efficient, and sometimes lethal for the planter. In order to simplify things in game terms planting will be divided into three simple categories:
         * Demolition: You want something specific to go boom and not necessarily everything around it. This means that the explosive is planted using Crafts (Demolition) + Logic (DT: 3, 1 minute), Extra successes count as if inflicting extra damage with an attack on the object.
         * Traps: You want something to be hidden and go off when a target is in the blast zone. This means that the explosive is planted using Thievery or Science + Wits (DT: 4, 1 Minute). All successes are counted against opposing perception checks.
Damage: This is the damage of the explosive. Packing multiple of the same explosives together ads +2 damage for each additional charge.
Size: The standard size for the explosive.
Blast radius: This denotes how large the area around the explosive that suffers damage. Do note that even outside the blast radius things can take damage such as windows shattering or causing temporary deafness.
If there are enough explosives to increase the damage up to 150% of the original then the blast radii are increased one size category, (close to short etc)
         * Inner: The area that suffers full damage.
         * Outer: This area suffers half damage.
Disarm: This denotes how many successes are needed on a Science (EOD) + Cool (DT: varied, 1 complex action) roll to disarm an explosive.
Failure: If the character has no successes on planting an explosive then it simply will not go off as intended. If the character rolls below the DT then each point of failure removes 2 points of damage from the explosion as the charge has been poorly placed.

Rules
Handling: handling acts as a bonus or penalty to the drivers Pilot dice pool.
Speed: This represents the vehicles maximum speed rating. See the chase chapter for more information.
Pilot: This indicates the vehicle's ability to follow orders autonomously. An autonomous vehicle rolls Pilot x2 +/- Handling to control itself.
Armor: This is a vehicles armor and functions as a barrier, passengers add the vehicles armor to their own when resisting targeted attacks. Attacks vs the vehicle is soaked by armorx2. Does not apply to animals who follow normal rules for living beings.
Seats: The first number indicates the number of pilots/drivers are needed to effectively pilot the vehicle. The second number is how many passengers the vehicle can support in addition to the pilots. 
Operating a vehicle with less than the required pilots gives; -1 to -4, to all vehicle related rolls down to half crew, after which point it is not possible to operate the vehicle as normal.
It is possible to cram more passengers into a vehicle but for each extra passenger Handling is decreased by 1. 


Quality
Poor: It's a bargain! 50% off the vehicle. Except it suffers a -1 to handling and Pilot. Furthermore, any Complications on pilot rolls with the vehicle are increased 1 severity, (minor to major.)


Standard: Has the stats and price as listed.


Impressive: These High Quality machines/animals cost 2x base price. (Minimum 2000) Rarity increased by 2. This increases the vehicle's handling by 1.


Exceptional Quality: Exceptional vehicles receive the bonus of the Impressive Quality. In addition the vehicles Speed and Pilot are increased by 1, non-animal vehicles also increase Armor by 1. Exceptional Quality cost 5x base price. (Minimum 5000). Rarity increased by 3.

Vehicle Modifications[kv]
Rules
A vehicle can have a number of modifications with a total size equal to the vehicle size x2.
Some modifications also have negative effects on the vehicle such as decreasing handling, speed or armor.
It is possible to take some modifications more than once. This is always specified.
Animals and Athletics vehicles cannot take modifications except the ones that specify otherwise.

Tolerance
Tolerance 6: Lowered Empathy. You suffer a -2 to Empathy rolls or other Social rolls that require you to identify with another person. Additionally you don’t suffer any physical or psychological issues from seeing death or gore unless its people who are important to you.
Tolerance 4:  Minor Delusions. You start perceiving things that aren’t there. If your eyes or ears are changed then the delusions are particularly prevalent in their spectra.
At this stage the delusions are minor. The GM can mention any small detail that your character perceives as real, such as a figure watching from a window or a noise around the corner.
Tolerance 3: Emotional outbursts. You have a hard time holding back. You easily become angry, melancholic or manic.[ld] Any significant emotional situation requires you to roll a mental resistance DT: (6 - Tolerance) a failure means you suffer the appropriate condition.
Tolerance 2: Super Psychosis. You are a superior specimen. All others are weak pitiful creatures. They cannot defeat you. Super Psychosis makes your character believe that they are unbeatable. They refuse to accept any loss and respond with denial and outrage. Whether it is a chess match or a combat scenario they will never accept defeat and will only retreat if they can do so feeling superior (like exiting the building they set aflame) or if they have a Lethal or Aggravated wound in one of their last 3 health boxes.
Tolerance 1: Major Delusions. You can barely register what is real anymore. Friends may look like enemies, enemies like friends, blood as confetti and a busy street as an empty verdant meadow. Any stressful situation requires you to roll a mental resistance DT: (6 - Tolerance)  a failure means that the GM dictates what you see and you accept it all as fact. This lasts until the stressful situation is resolved or calms down.
Tolerance 0: Frenzy. You risk losing control entirely. Any time you take damage you must roll a Mental Resistance DT: 4 or lose control. You must eliminate anyone and anything that COULD be a threat. That includes Enemies, Friends, passers by and animals (even caged ones). The Frenzy ends when you no longer perceive any threats.
Tolerance Negative: Risk permanent Frenzy. When you enter a frenzy. Roll 1d6. Every negative Tolerance you have counts upwards of the die. If you low equal to or below the negative then you will be stuck in a state of frenzy, even if your tolerance increases again.

Barriers


Structure: an object's “health”, known as its structure rating is equal to its size + armor rating x2. A wall is typically size 8-12 depending on how big, In addition when trying to get through a wall. Each doubling of the typical thickness adds half again as much size and armor to the structure rating. I.e. a house wall of brick Structure: 12 (Size: 10, armor: 2) that has two layers of brick has a structure of 18 (Size:10 +5, armor: 2+1) In order to increase again the wall needs to double in size again to four layers.
Soak: when damaging an object directly rather than trying to pierce it (such as with armor) it has a soak value of armor x2.
Armor: This is the value added to any target behind cover when trying to shoot through the material.
Damaging objects: In order to damage an object a weapon's damage must have a base damage value (or brawn + damage) greater than the object's soak - Armor piercing.
Objects with armor value >0 can only be damaged with weapons that do Lethal damage.
Attacking through objects: To pierce a barrier the weapon used has to be able to damage it (see damaging objects above). If it can then the attack proceeds as normal with the target adding the barriers armor (not doubled) to their soak. A pierced object suffers 1 structure damage.

[d]Should resistance checks be excluded? Makes sense to become less resistant when wounded etc. but may be too hampering.
[e]Minimum number total successes for qualified successes? 3, for impressive, 4 for exceptional?
[f]Minimum number total successes for qualified successes? 3, for impressive, 4 for exceptional?
[g]Addition first?
[h]update to new rule changes
[i]Fear, Panic
[j]Too harsh? Make sense? No WP cost?
[k]I like the wp cost; maybe make insufficient successes into minor complications and any minor complications into major?

[l]These are not the same loudness
[m]Make conditions for angry, melancholic and manic
[n]Make sure all exotic specialties are the same everywhere.
[o]Make magical specialties examples
[p]Use the purviews as inspiration.
[q]Make qualities cost straight XP instead of points?
[r]Make quality points 1-1 with xp (like merit points)?
[s]Problem is that I need to revise all XP for that because of balance reasons... I can put in XP instead easily enough but messing with the cost messes with everything so I am reluctant...
[t]Yeah, but if you start to make quality points 1-1 with xp, you would simply double the costs of all positive qualities. This would even allow to give more in-between numbers (2.5->5)
[u]I welcome better suggestions!
[v]CHange exotic specialties to be qualities?
[w]Combining Fighting styles/merits
[x]Specify off-hand penalty.
[y]Return after making drug stats.
[z]alter to fit new full auto rules
[aa]By wp bonus instead of static number?
[ab]Nah, while i like it in theory, ignoring up to 5 in threshold is too insane. Im not even sure it should be as much as 3...
[ac]Other options for the same actions?
[ad]At higher tiers, do other actions while restraining someone? (one-handed things such as shooting, magic, etc.)
[ae]Stunt driver 4? 5?
[af]4. You can work with any vehicle, increase handling?
5. Flexible driver, you can use a lot of environmental things to add bonus to your stunt (such as slanted wall for ramp, root of a tree for kickoff, etc.)?
[ag]I appreciate the suggestions, however... handling is just a straight up dice bonus, trying to stay away from general dice bonuses since they have other ways to be increased.
As for the flexible driver, that is mostly a cool descriptor of what a stunt already is...
[ah]Made some other suggestions though.
[ai]Changing with multiple attacks intead.
[aj]Not sure I like this one. Alternatives?
[ak]all these DT's could refer to peoples comp or mental resistance. imagine an skill lvl 12 assasin being foiled by a 1 rank merit for example
[al]Agree, mby use DT of metal resist/2 or something.
[am]Worried this becomes weird/useless
[an]Not everything always needs to be useful, but here I do worry that we can make a team of one diplomat with other fighters with high mental resist could lead to stunlocking the other team whilst punching the sh*t out of them.
[ao]Yeah. it was originally against a threshold which meant that either everyone was affected or nobody was.
[ap]Should probably list alchemy rules elsewhere for easier reading and examples.
[aq]Probably in the chapter on drugs and toxins.
[ar]Should probably just list these as spells...
[as]Yeah, add the spells with the requirement of a relevant number of levels in Blood-magic. That leaves room here for more general abilities such as making an athame etc.
[at]raise cost to 3
[au]Add more Spiritual Guides
[av]More? 2x aspected magic?
[aw]Either, leave it where it is (maybe make it up to 6 cost), or make it cost 8 and make aspected magic cost 2 (or 2.5) and let it be allowed to be taken multiple times.
[ax]Insert page nr/hyperlink
[ay]How should objects resist?
[az]Size + complexity or size*complexity
[ba]Double drain?
[bb]Make sustaining foci and foci crafting rules.
[bc]How should shields work?
[bd]Add armor equal to hits?
[be]How should damage spells function? Attribute? Spell level?
[bf]Skill level?
[bg]Dark shields?
[bh]Take away light in the area, creating black cloud, applying blindness condition?
[bi]Totally broken? Review!
[bj]Bypass only the armor of the soak. Let it be soaked by Brawn.
[bk]Stat undead.
[bl]Undead stats equal to half of stats when alive?
[bm]Make general detection rules.
[bn]Make up rules for attended object detection.
[bo]How should shields work?
[bp]Add armor equal to hits?
[bq]Make immobilized condition.
[br]Alternative: Stat Golems and caster gives +1 to attribute and skill per net success.
[bs]Make general detection rules.
[bt]Should they be called Virtue and Vice?
[bu]Opiate spell
[bv]define flaming weapon? magically enchanted weapon or flamethrower or arrow I lit on fire?
[bw]Should this be?
[bx]"target's brawn" perhaps?
[by]blessing spell
[bz]Add a mention about not healing Drain
[ca]Higher damage?
[cb]Brawn + half skill level?
[cc]Minor alteration summoning
[cd]Good? Bad? Backlash or not?
[ce]Good, with Backlash. Give free uses equal to half skill level.
[cf]Or varied by spirit type?
[cg]Yes but limit to either power or logic
[ch]Define IC
[ci]Device hit points????!!!!
[cj]What about things that dont use rolls i.e. calls for reinforcements etc.
[ck]you can maintain it with sustain and actions on your turn?
[cl]Alter time?
[cm]Or just net? Or different?
[cn]Better info: Dodge does not suffer reach penalties.
[co]Alter
[cp]Make rules for reaction
[cq]suggestion to use the same penalties as for ranged attacks. some more precise weapons can also be given qualities similar to animas "precise"
[cr]I have thought of this. however smaller weapons have lower reach and damage. the lower called shot penalties sort of made up for that. No solution I can think of is great.
Precision means you'll want the largest weapon with precision.
Current rules means theres no reason NOT to go for eyes/vitals.
Mixed alternative (listed in my comment below) is too complicated.
[cs]Possible alternative. (Too complicated but maintains the same idea) penalty is (5-target size) + weapon size.


It would mean hitting an eye (size 0) with fist is -5. Hitting with greatsword is -9.
[ct]Page number.
[cu]Page reference
[cv]Page reference
[cw]Page reference
[cx]Alternate roll for 1 per combat instead per turn
[cy]Make more accessible
[cz]Specify "At Weapons point"
[da]add modifiers for lifestyles
[db]add notes for resistant healing in the healing chapter
[dc]Feels excessive with 1 hour. Maybe 30 min?
[dd]I like 1 hour, just have high enough Brawn ;)
[de]Well 30 minutes of resting. May change if it feels excessive but I don't think so.
[df]Should there be complications on Healing? Suggest: no wound penalties, no complications, but exist as an optional rule
[dg]Only on lethal + Aggravated?
[dh]Should it be a roll?
[di]Make Nauseous condition.
[dj]Should this use range bands?
[dk]No, but give first Agi/2 meter for free and give max of 100 (or something) meters worth of damage.
[dl]Rules for being set on fire?
[dm]Take fire damage at end of turn until you put it out (simple or complex action (depending on size), either water or rolling).
[dn]Increase fire damage
[do]Make size*heat and lower heat to categories 2-5.
[dp]Rework with acid bath spell
[dq]look over bonuses
[dr]alter to use same speed rules
[ds]Lower threshold for too low speeds
[dt]Revisit after figuring out pilot ratings.
[du]highest successes (with auto?) dictates where they are in relation to the others
[dv]Revisit.
[dw]1x or 2x speed?
[dx]The formula for kinetic energy says half mass*speed squared.
[dy]But nobody wants to do that math in game.
[dz]How to calculate stun or Lethal?
[ea]Calc the lethal threshold as normal. Give upgrades the ability to always make it stun (such as airbags and seatbelts). 
Keep in mind how deadly cars are and how lifesaving the inventions we have put on them are.
[eb]Clarify speed effects on stunts, penalties only
[ec]Shield str requirement, 1 handed?
[ed]Penalty too great?
[ee]grenade miss rules.
[ef]Scatter rules are so funny. 1d8 for direction, 1d6 (or something) for the number of meters in that direction.
